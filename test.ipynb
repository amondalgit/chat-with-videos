       "'\\n## How big was the dream? \\n##So I think the original dream clearly was Seshadri\\'s and to an extent, P S Thyagarajan who was my advisor. How big was the dream I think is very difficult to say in retrospect because many things have changed since CMI started. I think I do recognize that Seshadri did want to have a teaching program because when CMI started it was a purely research institute. But what could be the scale in terms of number of faculty, number of students I don\\'t think anybody had a very clear idea. At that time also there were a lot of institutions which were starting. Typically these were being started by senior people who were retiring from their own places and many of them were in very small scale, you know 6-10 faculty. So I don\\'t think at that time we had any idea that it should become so big or so small. I think it was kind of more like an evolving plan. ##What was the vision in mind of the founders of CMI? How much confident they were about the vision? \\n##So the vision I think was to create a university like institution as opposed to research institute, like institution which, say IMSC is an example of this. The confidence of course if you have a vision like that you have to have some confidence that it can be done. I think in retrospect the confidence was more probably in Shashadri\\'s mind than in our minds. I do remember that when we started thinking about the teaching program and we were discussing it amongst us the younger faculty there was a lot of worry that this might be something which is something we cannot execute. And I do remember in this conversation strictly that there was 2 or 3 of us I don\\'t remember who maybe Balaji was there and so Shashadri told us more or less, that you have to develop the confidence that you can do it. If you keep doubting it will not happen. So I think that was an important message. I think that somehow strangely for somebody who seemed to be very abstract like Sheshadri it came to him naturally to take risks in this kind of things. So I think that philosophy then I think after that once we got started the teaching program was probably the biggest change in the philosophy or the thinking of CMI. Because till then it was only a research institute, few faculty, PhDs doing very traditional kind of things. But then after that moving to a new campus, developing new types of programs, industry all these things I think became easier to imagine because one experiment had worked. \\n##And when CMI started so was there any plan B in the mind of others if it doesn\\'t work? \\n##I don\\'t think there was any plan B. So I think everybody had the idea of course that it may not work. For various reasons one most important of course being resources that you know it\\'s not very clear how much a private company would be able to sustain an institution of this kind. \\nCome, come. So we have some, be prepared you have to do some answering questions. \\nSo you had started thinking of mind training. So yeah, so I think when the institute started there was a very real fear or not fear but very real possibility that it was an experiment which need not succeed. So there were always of course possibilities that people would have to, faculty would have to look for other positions and all that. So I don\\'t think it was a conscious. There was no conscious plan B but there was always a subconscious expectation or I would say not even expectation but acceptance that this is not guaranteed to succeed. And in that sense various people did you know think about what would happen if this goes down and all that. But fortunately it did not happen that way. But I don\\'t think there was ever any conscious plan B. Okay. But everybody was, Seshadri of course was by that time he would pass the entire mid-age in any standard sense but most of the other people who joined one thing was that they were selected. Of course as we continue to do based on their performance in other things. So I think everybody who joined had the confidence that if this did not work out they would find something else. At least on the faculty side. The harder thing is always a commitment even if it is only PIC students. It\\'s a commitment to students that if you have vacant students and they are supposed to be doing their work and you cannot finish that then it\\'s a much bigger responsibility. But for the faculty and for the institution as a whole I think it\\'s a smaller risk if it\\'s only a question of people finding other jobs and people could have worked and it\\'s a fortune that it did not come to that. \\n##So any institutions or any companies start so there are two types. One is founder and other is finances. So how the initial finances came and how stable it was at that point of time? \\n##So the initial finances of course as you know the genesis of CMI is this mode of mathematics so what is called the SPIC science mode. So SPIC is a big petrochemical company. Southern petrochemicals and at that time in the late 1980s they were doing financially quite well because one of the things they make is fertilizers which is of course in heavy demand at any given time. And it was a controlled industry. It was a lot of subsidies. So therefore the company was assured of certain, I mean the government would pay some minimum price and so on. So in fact that was probably the motivation for starting the science foundation. I think SPIC had ambitions to be like you know of course in those days the two industrial houses associated with education and research were Tata\\'s and Birla\\'s because they had institutions in their names. So I think SPIC had ambitions to be in that league. And I think to be fair I think not the specific SPIC company but the family in an extended sense has been involved in education. You know there is this Satyamevalli University which is also started by a branch of that family and so on. So I think there is a history of that community supporting education. So therefore when we started we had the backing of, I mean so the origin of CMI in that school of mathematics there was another division in the SPIC science foundation headed by a person called Dr. S. Patrasanti. So he was, though there were multiple divisions he was kind of a de facto the overall head of the SPIC science foundation. And he assured Seshadri that you know there is a commitment and even if the outcome of this institution is not directly relevant to the parent company there is no issue. They are very keen to do this. So we started with some financial assurance but at a certain scale. Now over 10 years what happened was on one side because of deregulation of the Indian economy and things like fertilizer subsidies being removed the financial stability of SPIC reduced. And on the other side because CMI\\'s ambitions grew to a teaching program and having to sustain a larger size activity our demands grew. So that resulted in the first, so actually the first signs of some kind of uncertainty about the finances actually happened about the time when the UG program was started. So that\\'s when really the mismatch started becoming clear because one was going down, one was going up. And it was clear that they could not sustain that thing. But then fortunately at that time the Sriram group and Raj Pyagajan stepped in. So at opportune times we have always found somebody to help us. But in the beginning I think when it started I think this financial aspect at least at the scale at which CMI was planned was not an issue. Otherwise I don\\'t think it would have started. You can\\'t start with uncertainty. \\n##Who were some initial people who joined the vision of Seshadri or with the founders, basically? \\n##So you know within CMI or outside CMI? \\n##Outside CMI. \\n##So outside is difficult to say but within first of all the core faculty of CMI was actually some of it was inherited from IMSC because it was coincided with some uncertainty at IMSC. So Seshadri and Pyagajan of course knew. Now actually regarding this plan B issue which you mentioned earlier. So one thing I should probably mention is that there were some people who were involved in the planning of CMI or in this dealing with uncertainty, who I think consciously stayed back. So among them was Madhuri and Ramanujan and Kamal Rudaya. Because it was felt clearly at that time that the solution is not to evacuate IMSC and create a parallel institution but to keep both and hope that both will sustain and become together more powerful in some sense or more effective than one another. So in that sense there was a plan B not for CMI itself but for the sustainability of the mathematics group that was being built in Chennai. So in that sense implicitly therefore IMSC people were involved and they have been traditionally involved with even the teaching program and building up. So support has always been there from IMSC and right from the beginning even PhD students and all activities in the early days of the computer science group certainly were very pretty back and forth between the two institutions. So within Chennai I think there was a lot of support in these two institutions together. And I think outside also because Seshadri was quite, I mean he had already got his FRS while he was in IMSC. So he was quite recognized as a senior mathematical figure in the Indian community. So in the kind of government circles his name was known. So there was implicit support through individuals who had been in contact with him and with TIFR and all that. So that way it was easy for him to ask people, who had potentially decision making people in the government for support. Not that it came but at least that access was there.\\n\\n## So, how many professors who joined CMI and what motivated them to join? Was there a common goal or something else was there? \\n##So, number was not very large. I guess in mathematics other than Seshadri and Balaji who was of course a product of the same system. We had this Number-theorist called Anupam Srivastav came and then Pramath Shastri joined soon after that. So, these were some of the initial people. I think many of them joined the mathematics group because of Seshadri\\'s stature. And because they were also of course Anupam Srivastav was from a different area. But I think they had some expectation that this would be something to their liking. There was a lot of uncertainty about the private versus public. So, one thing that Seshadri did was to ensure, that even in those days when there was no funding at all coming from any government source that the salary structure and the designations in CMI would be similar to those of other academic institutions. Because on the other side, the SPIC Science Foundation which we were part of was more like an R&D. So, they were like research managers and things like that. So, it was never to be that way. Computer science, so Jagrajan was the sort of leader of the group. And some of the people who joined here soon after I did. I was the second person I guess to join on the faculty. But then we had Manindra Agarwal and Nitin Soni who joined. And both of them were I mean similar age group to both exactly are in fact my match mates. So, it was a combination of I guess again professional, what should I say, confidence that Jagrajan was again a well established computer scientist. And that fact that he would do something which is generally in the right direction. Of course, both of them for personal reasons soon after that I mean 2-3 years later they left. But I think they left a good mark in terms of their impact. So, in the early years it was little hard to get people to join. So, KV was one of the people who joined soon afterwards. And we had Raghavan who joined in mathematics. Again Raghavan who is now at IMSC. Paramesh Shankaran also joined around that time. But each case was a hard sell in some sense. Because many things had to be right I mean in those days also culturally there was a bigger difference. So, many people who were not from the south or not from Chennai were little apprehensive about settling down here. Especially, I mean specifically, both Milind and Manindra left I think largely because of family constraints. That they would not be able to convince their families to stay here in long-term basis. And the other thing as I said is this you know the fact that it is not a traditional institution. It does not have any guaranteed source of funding, it does not have housing, it does not have all the things that people come to expect. So, now I think the situation these days is more varied. But I think there was only one constraint at that time of academic institutions and CMI was very far from that. So, it was definitely I mean every gain was a big, every hiring was a big gain and every resignation was a big loss. \\n##What motivated you to join? Very initially only the idea was there, nothing more than the idea. \\n###So, in fact when I applied, I applied to CMI only extensively. So, two of us were graduating from TIFR at the same time Anil Singh and me. And we were wondering whether to apply to Mathematical Science in IIT Bombay. And I just happened to, of course Madhavan was my classmate from in BSc days. So, I came here, I met Tyagu, I gave a talk and it went off very smoothly. And then I, Tyagu sort of at least got talking and at this point there was a mention of probably having a teaching institute and sort of growing this bottom up from researchers into a teaching institute and that sort of fascinated me. So, and of course I knew Madhavan very well and Tyagu also was quite an impressive personality that way. And Seshadri had a very magnetic sort of personality, I think. And so I knew of him through his brother who was a very close friend. And somehow out of his appeal and I said okay. So, I just made my PhD. So, I said okay it\\'s worth taking a chance and jump in and see. And again as Madhavan said I was confident if it does not work out I will always find something else. So, that\\'s not so easy that time. I was very sure. In fact my delivery to academics also was a bit strange. I never thought I would do academics. But I got in and I was quite happy and I said if it does not work out, we will find out something else. But the idea of sort of jumping into a new institution happened and my father was completely surprised that I made this decision. \\n##I think those kind of stories. \\n##He in fact was straight up, he has been with, he was with the Department of Atomic Energy since 1957. And for him to not apply to a place like IMSC and then get here, he thought it was a little bit foolish. But then I told him this is worth an experiment. I think, if it succeeds, it\\'s great. I think we would be quite happy. And he kept advising me to apply to Math-Science. I said go on another, put a friend of mine in line. Maybe he may not take two of us. But we will continue to work on this. And I got invited to do this. I had a proposition. Madhvan was here, Meena was already here. So, when it, yeah, Milind was already here. Manindra, I knew very well. And in fact when I joined, Manindra and I, we overlapped. And actually, and it was a good sort of academic environment. I would discuss with Manindra quite a lot actually in the initial stages. Learning from each other. And then I would go to Mad Science, I would meet people both industrial and academic, and do other things. The culture was good actually. Somehow at that point I thought Chennai was a very nice place to stay also. Otherwise terrible, but it\\'s a good place. I mean, I could cycle all the way to T Nagar from where I was. And so this, all this seemed curious but attractive. So I said okay, we\\'ll take a chance. As I said I was willing to take a chance. And things, I\\'m glad things have come out like that. \\n##So your parents wanted you to have some kind of job secretary? \\n###Yes, yes. Mad Science, \\n##you experimented with this idea, a new idea. A new idea. Yes, certainly. So I think most people of that age would probably have advised their children to go for a job. But we were willing to experiment. And at some level I also knew that there is some financial stability there in the back. In case things desperately fail, my father would be able to support me for some time. Not that I needed it, but I was sure that I would get a good job. I was like 100% sure of that. So there was that confidence. And it really seemed like something that would be worthwhile. I mean if we did take off into teaching and so on. Because teaching is something, even in the early stages I thought I could become a good teacher. I would have spent time. \\n##So this interview is divided into three parts. One is initial, middle and the end, the future. So we are kind of closing on the initial part. 15 minutes, may be a little. Yes, 18 minutes. 18 minutes. Ok, that is fine.\\n\\n##What motivated the initial students to join CMI? It was just the idea. So, how their parents were confident of sending their kids here and how they feel same, what was in their mind, how did they proceed? \\n###That is, so in 1998 when we decided to sort of start off the BSc, yeah it was an experiment. We were not sure anybody would apply also actually. But we said, okay, we need to do it, let\\'s do it and let\\'s see. So, we would have, and we were very clear in our minds, we would get even 10 students, we would be very happy actually. We said that is where we could begin. We were anyways, faculty wise not large in numbers, they are very small, but Maths, Science was there always. Yeah, but somehow we all felt that it will, there was a feeling that it should work. Because people would look at the kind of people that are there in the institute and they would join. This is what we felt, but we were not sure. And yeah, so when, so I don\\'t remember the number of people, but maybe close to 150, probably 100, 150, that\\'s all I think we got. We held the exam and some people came up for joining and actually as we were talking to the parents, it became clear to them that we are very committed to what we want to do. And I think some parents were convinced and what certainly helped was that, there was one student who was actually part of the Indian Mathematics Olympiad team and he had decided to join. So, that was a big thing, actually, he just rejoined. That really, I think, and there was some conscious effort by the people who were running the Olympiad teams to try and talk to the people in the camp to join a place like this. And that magic seemed to work and there were a few people responsible for that, maybe in the initial stage. So, certainly I think that really helped. The fact that there were teachers who were actually teaching these Olympiad children and students were generally interested in mathematics and the teachers telling them that no, this is a place we want to join in mathematics, this is the place to be. So, there I think certainly, you know, this one. Yeah, Yogananda. Yogananda, I think he played a very pivotal role, I think we should say this too. I think he was a highly respected teacher for all those children. These were children in their 12th standard and they can be very influenced, actually. And they joined. And PSB joining, I think, made a big difference to the other five. Who also joined. \\n##There was one more, I think, Debapriyo. Yeah, so I think there were two out of the six in that batch. I think Debapriyo was also a member of the Olympic team in the Olympiad training camp, at least not the team. Tejaswi was not just a team member but he was a rare Indian Gold medalist in those days in the batch and their team. But yeah, I think Yogananda had really played a really, I would say, very big role in popularizing and publicizing this as an alternative. because Yogananda is the same, roughly, generation as we are of PhD students. So Yogananda had joined IMSC for a PhD about maybe a year or two before I had joined. He was working with Balu. So he knew all of the people at CMI from an early stage, even though he, after his PhD, went on to a different, he didn\\'t stay in Chennai. So to the extent that I remember specifically that Tejaswi had actually joined IIT and he had paid the deposit, which in those days was not as much as it is now but it was a substantial amount of money. It was like 10,000-20,000 rupees. And Seshadri spoke to the director of IIT and they agreed to give the money back. So it was a non-trivial thing for Tejaswi to make this decision and we were luckily, thanks to Seshadri\\'s good connections with the IIT establishment, actually convinced IIT to allow him to not take the seat which he had committed to. And I think, yeah, that impact of that early confidence from the Olympiad students at CMI, I think is really what established its image as something where you should, I mean, if you are able to overcome all your family\\'s apprehensions, it is, academically there is no doubt about it. I think that was established right after, because of this. \\n##So we are finished with the dream and initial part. So we will do the middle part. So once the institute started working, what kind of challenges CMI and CMIâ€™s  students faced? \\n##So of course on the academic side, there was the obvious challenge, which is that, as the number of students went up. First because when the BSc program was produced with first graduates, we started the MSc program. So that meant of course the number of courses and the variety of courses that we needed to teach, grew and we were obviously not in a position to identify faculty at that speed. So identifying people to come and teach. But there I think one of the things that again held us in good stead even later on was that a number of senior people who had retired. So in those days, you know, Professor Nagarajan had come to help out, Professor Sridharan had come. Then we had Professor Nandgani who had come. So we had a lot of such people who were very well respected academics and professors at other universities. Who again I think partly because Tulsi does these things. So these were people who had really a passion for teaching, passion for students. And now after that, nowadays we still have VV Rao and a number of such people. So I think that helped. But certainly one big challenge was this part, which is how to run the number of courses that we need to run to cater to an expanding program. The other big challenge was infrastructure. Because within the T Nagar building which we were, every time we had to send a standing instruction to the landlords or the supervisor of the building saying anytime any company is vacating, tell us and we will try to grab that space. Because we had no other source of classrooms or other resources and office space. So it was a permanent expansion project. But more and more it was clear that side by side the other thing was students\\' accommodation. Because it was very clear from the beginning that the majority, if not all of our students are coming from outside Chennai. So we don\\'t really have any day scholars. Everybody is staying. So we had made arrangements to rent houses for them. But just the logistics of that, first of all, renting out to students itself, there is a lot of prejudice amongst people. So finding places where people are willing to rent it out to 4-6 students is one thing. Second thing is just organizing food and other things. We tried some experiments with some centralized food delivery. So that second challenge was to actually address this logistics thing. Of course, getting a campus was a huge financial step which we were not capable of doing. So we had to really work towards convincing our R Thyagarajan who was our main financial source, private source of support. And this was a worthwhile requirement to pursue. So these were the two main things. Funding-wise, of course, in terms of salaries there was always some uncertainty. But already now after the teaching program started, NBHM was supporting. So we were getting some external support from the government plus Thyagarajan\\'s support. So it was actually looking... And at that time, Dr. Anil Kakodkar, when he became the chairman of DAE, he was very supportive. So the DAE support looked quite promising. So we were not so worried about the support for running expenses. But certainly, this organizing the logistics and getting over the limited kind of campus that we had, I think that was the big issue. So something that we should probably add. Just like faculty sort of... Can we meet after? \\n##Sure, sure. \\n##Just like faculty joined thinking that this is a good experiment to be with. \\n##We were very lucky to have staff members also who joined. And who were as sort of passionate about this, as all of us were. So at some point, it became sort of a... Something that we all sort of saw as a dream that we should make. A dream that should succeed. I think almost everybody felt that. This was true of external faculty members like Madan Singh. Retired faculty members who joined. Prior faculty members within the institute. Mad Science people. And also the staff. We were very lucky to have the staff that we had. Rajeshwari, Sripati, who was again a solid rock there. And the way you could communicate with people. As Madhavan said, it was not easy to get people to rent out rooms for 18 year old boys. There were mostly boys at the time. Few girls. It\\'s not easy to convince them to rent out these things. But I think Sripati had agreed the people to talk to them. And convince them that this is something good. And they are actually pursuing mathematics. They are not harrowing boys. All those things also made a big difference. And then people like Rajeshwari and Swapna were also willing to sort of... Who were very keen that people would really want to talk to the parents. Want to talk to the students. Make them comfortable. I mean you also joined in the first batch for the Masters. And I think what really mattered was the way students were treated also. I think that was something different. It had a big impact on the students wanting to join. When it appears to be a friendly environment, not only are the staff friendly, even the teachers are friendly. You can question them. I think those things certainly helped in sort of accelerating the growth. And of course there were other things that sort of played out. I mean Madhavan said, Dr. Anil Kakodkar becoming the chairman. It certainly helped. And they saw value in this whole thing. And of course Seshadri is a very charming figure as I said. And I think he has his way with people. He had a vision and he was able to communicate that vision to a lot of people. Including the staff. Not that he would say anything, I think. Just the fact that he sort of had achieved in some sense the pinnacle of mathematical glory. And the fact that he was dreaming about this, I think helped. \\n##Yeah, so I just wanted to add one thing in terms of challenges that you said. So actually this is a non-trivial challenge in itself. Dealing with students. Because till we started a teaching program, we didn\\'t have to deal with, see students come with their own problems which adults don\\'t have. You know one thing is of course they are young and they are away from home. So you also have to deal with anxieties of parents. But they are also confused about maybe different things, cultural differences. So having some people like Rajeshwari and so on, who could relate to them and listen to them and try to suggest to us also needs to be talked to. I think because with a small number of PhD students, these problems are very minor compared to them. Because they are older and their problems are different. They are mostly academic. They don\\'t typically... but here it\\'s really adjustment. Plus of course the logistics is one part of having a hostel. But the fact that there are a reasonable number of young people in one place is guaranteed to throw up some challenges from a day to day basis. So that\\'s something that we had to learn how to do well. And even now it\\'s a problem. ##So once CMI established, everything was going on fine. So did you see any kind of attrition in professors or some staffs or anything? So challenges from that front. And how you got new professors? \\n##So I think that even when we moved to this new campus, which was late 2005, we were still struggling on that front. I think that as I said before, you know, in the 90s also every new person we managed to attract to join was a huge success and every person who left was a huge disappointment. And as I said, most people left not fortunately at least because they were dissatisfied with CMI, but because there was usually some extraneous family compulsion that we... It\\'s mostly that they came from a different part of the country and they wanted to go back home. So I would say that, you know, the scale of the faculty at CMI did not really grow much till about 2010 or so. Then at that point, for whatever reason maybe, because I think that, see, moving to this campus, of course on one side was physically useful for us because we had all the facilities that we needed to run the program, to host the students and all that. But I think also it\\'s symbolic that having a campus gives a certain perception to external people, whether they are funding people or whether they are prospective faculty, that this is a slightly more well established... One of the concerns is that where is the basis for this institution. So maybe because of that, but I think there was a bigger jump around 2010, in the two-three years, around the time that batches had joined, you know, that there was a sudden jump and we almost doubled our faculty. So from being somewhere, you know, in the 10 to 15 range, we moved, you know, in the 25 to 30 range. I think that really made... then we became comfortable that, you know, we are going to have enough people around. But till around 2010, I think, it was touch and go in terms of this flow in and flow out and it was very delicate. ##Again, one thing to say was that where faculty who joined us in the initial stages actually stayed on for a long time, even in those northern layers. After in some sense, having stayed on for at least 7-8 years, maybe longer, so in the very initial stages, after I joined, soon after I joined, Kumar joined, Harvindar, who was at the same time, Claire joined and Claire has always been with us, she continues to be with us. Yeah, so as Madhavan said, so and all of them, so again, these are all people almost of the same age as Madhavan and me and again the enthusiasm to sort of, whether it is compared to interacting with students or to teach. So, and their numbers were small, so one could actually, you knew every student almost personally actually. So that certainly helped and then the students also started talking to their youngsters, their batch mates in their schools. So the ball got rolling as far as students were concerned. We had a steady stream of students coming in, there was no problem. But teaching was of course another problem, but we had to sort of deal with a larger and larger number of students, larger and larger number of courses, we need to produce some courses which were out of scope of our expertise actually. But then everybody chipped in. I mean people have taught compilers, people have taught architecture, things are not working at all, but people have managed to teach these things actually. And one thing that one can say is that everybody was confident that, okay, I need to teach it, I have studied it and I will teach it, I will do a good job. I think that capability, I think even, so everybody realized that this is something that could be done. So that helped. And as Madhavan said, I think moving to the campus was a big thing. Moving to the campus was a big thing. In the beginning it was difficult because this campus was way out of the city at that point. So it brought with it different kinds of challenges. People were very used to just walking across the road and going to a restaurant or a place and eating. Now suddenly you have to find a comp, you have to find a canteen, you have to get a canteen to get food, those kinds of things. So there were different challenges. But, yeah, again, it is nice that there was a collective effort to sort of make things happen. I think that was always there. There was attrition, but for different reasons, I think. But there was also a lot of goodwill that we had. Goodwill always in the long run. We had a lot of goodwill from a lot of people, people who even left. There was goodwill on their part to send, to make sure that things are stable here. \\n##So, and for that, you need a top talent, right? And for a consistent period of time. So how do you manage that top talent from the student side and the faculty side? So mostly from the student side. Because initially you got a few stars, but how do you manage those stars in the long run and till now? \\n##So I think that initial students joining set an expectation, I think. And so therefore, this position of being within the Olympiad community of being a place which people should aspire to go. I think in some sense they advertised it better than anything that we could do. So I still think that most people don\\'t know about CMI. But among the students who are interested in this, they know about it because of their peer groups. I think it is not due to anything effort or talent, but honestly, but it is more due to word of mouth publicity from the student community. Also, I think to a small extent, maybe it helped that around that time is when the internet also picked up. So you had, you know, kind of initial stages of social media, some kind of this Quora like things where people would ask questions and all that. And I think that helps. I mean, it may not always work well, but I think in those more innocent early days, I think it helped to popularize CMI among the people who are interested in it. So I think that having a selection process already, I think guarantees that you will get good people. But the right people with the right interests joined, I think comes from something else. And that we were lucky to have. Again, the numbers that we were looking for and numbers joining were not huge. I mean, even when it went up, it was not more than typically 50-20. I think till, I think even 10 years ago, I think that was the typical size of a UG batch. And MSc batches were, you know, your batch was 5. But it was not very much in double figures even at that time. So the numbers were much smaller. So therefore, the number of people applying was much smaller. But I think the quality and that part was not a problem because the people who were applying were typically people who were motivated, interested. And they were self-selecting in some sense. I don\\'t think we had to give them that. And then among them, we had the luxury of choosing the best. That always was how things worked. \\n##And then the other thing that certainly helped was that both the UGs who graduated as well as the PGs who graduated, a large number of them actually went on to do further studies. You see, that makes a big impact on the kind of institute this is. The fact that people are actually going for doing PhDs and they are doing well, you see, that makes a big difference. Going to good places. Then there is a steady, then you can expect that this will continue. Because in some sense, there is a, you have set a certain kind of standard. And then students who observe this say, okay, this is where I want to be. They self-select themselves, actually. So the exam was also sort of slightly different. Not the usual exam. Because we did have a serious part of actually long answers that we would had to correct. We had the luxury of doing it, but we didn\\'t have too many students applying. And then we could actually look carefully. And I think students who were already probably slightly ahead of the curve would apply. And they would self-select themselves. And they would go on to do well. And then next path will naturally follow this. We were lucky in that aspect also. That those days people were actually looking to join higher studies. Not as it is now, where people probably are looking more in terms of jobs. But of course, actually at CMI, the trend continues, that people are, majority of people still go on and study further. But I think that certainly had a big impact. Where the students went after they graduated from CMI. \\n##And CMI got that brand name that students go abroad.\\n##Yes, certainly. Yes, and then the other thing that happened naturally was some of these students coming back. That also happened. And so there again we were very lucky that a good number of our students who went out actually started coming back. And this is something that people observe that CMI students are actually coming back. So that again was a positive feedback. And the other thing that happened sort of organically at that point was that, other UG programs also started. So then there was a, so we were a bit concerned. But CMI still remained the preferred designation actually. So that also helped. You see that despite having other UG programs that people could choose for, still chose CMI. So then it is not very difficult for 11th standard and 12th standard students to continue to say I will go there. Because this is where.. this person went and he had a chance to join IISER. He had a chance to join some other place. But he decided to join here and I will also go there. So I think that also, there were other UG programs but CMI continued to be a preferred destination. And that also, and of course now there is a good healthy competition among all these different UG programs. And it is good that we have finally come to a point where there are a good number of undergraduates who are being trained in this kind of mathematics, this kind of computer science across the country. Now even more institutions than this one could. \\n##Now the third important part is financial stability in the long run. From 2000 to let\\'s say, year 2020-2021. So what kind of challenges you faced and how you managed that? There must be something.\\n##So I think this is still a work in progress. I think initially as I said Dr. Kakodkar became the chairman of DAE. There was a lot of optimism. He himself had kind of a plan to somehow bring CMI within a stable DAE kind of structure. Now for reasons which are not clear to anybody, at various stages these attempts were not completed. So on the one side there was this constant expectation or hope that something like this would happen. And in the absence of that then any funding from the government tends to be on a year to year basis with no guarantee. So we had to manage somehow. But fortunately for a good amount of time, maybe certainly throughout the period that Dr. Kakodkar was in charge, whatever we asked for from DAE, more or less we got. So till about 10 years ago, I think that more or less our entire requirement for running expenditure was coming from a DAE grant. And we didn\\'t really have... So this campus, building it was out of scope of DAE money because they cannot use that money for infrastructure. But so this campus was built with substantial private donations. And so we needed some private donations and some ad hoc things to build up some infrastructure. So we got some project like grants from DST to get all the equipment. I mean one of the things that we did not anticipate is moving from a few rooms in T Nagar to this place was that, we need that many more tables and chairs, that many more computers. I mean it was a big exercise just... It\\'s like you move from a one room house to a ten room house. You know you don\\'t have furniture to set up the place. So those things you can get on a one off basis. But it was really the salaries and the running expenditure that was a problem. Along that time DAE was there. And then slowly around 10 years ago I think the culture of getting money from corporates became a little bit more. So the big thing was of course getting this one big Infosys corpus when CSR first started. So now... Yeah so then there were some further hitches along the way. There was an attempt by DST to support along with DAE. But again because of some... So the problem we have faced with the government promises is that, promises have been very generous. But there are many steps between the promises and the execution and that\\'s very hard to navigate. And especially maybe it\\'s easier to navigate if you are closer to Delhi and you can meet people there. But whatever it is we have had mixed... So one side, DAE had been very supportive to the extent that they were able to... But getting it to become formalized now whether it\\'s a good thing or a bad thing to be part of DAE is a different issue. Possibly some of the things that we are doing would be much more difficult if we had been bound by some governmental regulations. On the other hand some of the anxiety that we would have had about funding may have been less. So it\\'s difficult to say. But I think on the whole it\\'s been a little bit of an experiment. I think that, as we have gone along we have been hit by and taken advantage of changes. So one side the changes have been negative in the sense that the government support in general for... I think these kind of institutions outside the existing commitments they have been reducing. So it has been harder to get money from the government. But fortunately the commitment or the vision of corporates supporting education and generally, you have seen now, private universities not come up. So the idea that all educational institutions need not be fully government supported has become more normal. But still we are not in any way able with our programs how to support ourselves through tuitions or something. I mean the fee that we charge cannot cover more than 10-15% of our requirement. But still even getting to the fact that when we charge some fees for the change. Till then it was seen as an advantage to not charge fees because then the government has a justification to support you. Some point the government started telling even IITs to raise their own resources. Then we were forced to in some sense change our strategy. So it has been that way, I think, running CMI in this direction has been very different from maybe many other similar institutions in the country. Where we have constantly needed to cultivate sources of funding. So far we have managed and we are confident going forward that we have... ...See, I think we are fortunately at a scale where it is possible to do this. I mean if we were very small we would be unsustainable. Nobody would want to fund us. If we are very big then the amount of money we need is very difficult to raise. But in the kind of scale that we are at it is possible to supplement some government commitment with some judicious tapping of private resources. So we have been I think, it is not a design but it has come out that way that we have managed. The other thing is that we have, thanks to this constant worry about it... ...I think we have also been very I would say efficient about our resources. In salaries is one thing where you have to compete. I mean you cannot be offering lower salaries and call people to join. But in other things you know, we use our resources quite too well. So we don\\'t for example just routinely replace equipment unless there is a reason to replace it. And even travel. People need to go for a... ...say one of the big for an institution like ours what do the faculty need, right? So they are not experimentalists. They don\\'t need big equipment or some chemicals or something. They need flexibility about going to visit colleagues, attend conferences, collaborate. So even that money we have not a huge pile of money but people are very cooperative about it. So we don\\'t have any artificial rule saying that one person can only go once a year and it can be... ...so we say you need something you tell us and we feel it is good with you we will provide and people respect that. So I think the same spirit, with which everybody was kind of working, in the initial days throughout setting up this program, I think that spirit continues. That people agree that there are resources which is on a common feature and we will respect that. And not make unreasonable demands and then it works. So I think having this uncertainty over funding has of course been a big headache. But it has also I think shaped somehow the way the institute runs. And I think that going forward I think we see that this goodwill and recognition of the institute... ...I think at the scale will keep this private support. I think it will never be guaranteed but I think it will not be so difficult to continue that support. \\n##So maybe one thing we forgot to mention was the support that we got from one particular gentleman actually. Dixit. Professor H.P. Dixit. So in fact when we set out to sort of start the program it was very difficult to figure out who would give the degrees. \\n##So our initial stages were being given by BITS. \\n##But undergraduate degrees are a bit difficult because every institute has its own way of... ...has its own quality check and so on. So then we were very lucky that Professor Dixit sort of he was the vice-chancellor of the MP Bhoj Open University(MPBOU). And he just loved this idea of researchers teaching children mathematics and neuroscience and setting up a high quality institution. He had great faith in Seshadri and he visited us many times and he felt that this was a wonderful initiative to support. So he gave us in some sense blank papers saying you guys go ahead we will support you. So in the initial stages that\\'s the way it happened. And then he was also very sort of kind to point out to us, that we could apply for a Deemed University status based on what we were already doing. So that again was something that helped. So once you get a UGC status, a status of a university, then even among parents were a bit sort of thinking, wavering this way or that way. The fact that you are actually a UGC recognized institution helps greatly. And there I think, again this support I think, one should actually record it the kind trust and faith we had. I mean again it\\'s the same way that we wanted the institute to succeed and people wanted the institute to succeed. We had no different view of that. That one view actually. \\n##How good we are on time?\\n##It\\'s 34 minutes. 34 and a half was 18 minutes. \\n##So you can edit it. Yeah you can edit it. I mean your time. Your time is most important. So your question is that this is what you wanted right? Yeah. The degree part. Yeah so this was the question, \"What are the challenges you might face with providing these degrees? How did you make the initial collaboration with the reputed institutes?\" \\n##So of course, thanks to the fact that people like Seshadri and Jagarajan had come from, I mean Seshadri of course had come from TIFR. He had done, during his PhD he had extensive interactions with the French mathematicians. So that natural connection was there with France in particular and international mathematics in general. So even in the early days of starting even before CMI, within IMSC when Seshadri was there, people used to come from outside India and spend time and give courses. And similarly Thiagarajan moved to IMSC and then to CMI but after spending his entire career in Europe. So he also had a lot of contacts. So at an international level we had through them and the Government also enabled certain things. Like for example in the computer science also in mathematics, the Zindogan Center for joint collaborations to be funded. So then right from the beginning that way we have had a lot of very high profile and illustrious people coming from international institutions to come and spend time. And one of the things that was established at the early start of the teaching program was this formal arrangement with EMS, the Ecole Normale SupÃ©rieure in Paris. So that, students from here at the end of the third year could go and spend some time there. Initially it does not work very well decently but some senior students from there would come and teach at least a part of the course or come and get some teaching experience. So I think many of these were already in place because the initial faculty who started, had contacts. And then once that happens then the connections continue. And within India of course we had people coming from other, of course, TIFR and usual mathematics community there was a natural connection. But in for example computer science we had people like Manindra and Bill, who came here and then they went back to IIT Bombay and IIT Kanpur. And of course in IMSC Vinay had come and then he joined IISC. So again that community was quite small. I mean this theoretical computer science community as a number of people was quite small. But we were plugged into that community. So I think among Indian academic institutions also I think it was a very natural connection. So I don\\'t think we had to do anything extra to make it happen. Because there were already connections and the connections through... As people joined they brought their own connections. \\n##But I think one thing I should mention is the French connection with the computer scientists sort of strengthened through their civic projects. Both Madhavan and Kumar, the initial days they had a civic project and that really helped. I think because they were doing some fantastic work. So once you start doing work at that international level, I think then you become recognized at all the international forums. And then it becomes sustainable actually. Good work is always something that everybody respects. And I think the French group also realized the quality of work that is coming out of here. And they would also want to collaborate. It\\'s not, it has to happen that way. You can\\'t go on to good work and expect others to join you. So you have to do good work. And then even in the other areas, people were producing really good work. I mean it\\'s not, people were doing good work. And good work coming out from Chennai Mathematical Institute, you see good, look at the top conferences, people were producing papers, writing good papers in top journals. So then the name sort of gets established. It\\'s not very difficult for international people to recognize that here is a good place. And that they are actually doing some good work. And that feeds on itself. \\n##And you sustained the student for so long, you need a culture also. So how do you maintain that culture from initial to now and in future also? Because people from various backgrounds will be joining, students, faculty and other staff. \\n##Yeah, that is I think a big question. I think initially as KV said, because it was a small place and there was a kind of energy and excitement with building the place. I think a lot of what we see around us, I think even in this campus. The fact that these buildings are now about 17 years old, right, and it doesn\\'t seem like it is such an old. So therefore the maintenance and keeping things looking good cannot happen if people are not involved. So I think everybody who has grown with this institute sees it as a kind of personal involvement. It\\'s like at home, you see a tap leaking you don\\'t expect that somebody in the house will go, you will point it out or you will call the plumber. So from that level, if something is not working properly, anybody who notices it feels both concerned enough and their duty to, I mean they are not trying to fix it, but at least initiate to draw people\\'s attention to it. And it could be at any level. It could be about the way things are, it could be tangible things about things not working, it could be intangible things about better ways to organize. So the more difficult thing is, so people who come, because it\\'s a small institution, we have seen that recent faculty, of course some of our faculty who have joined recently are same alumni, so they already are used to this, but even the other people who have come, I think because it\\'s a small enough group and they see people collaborating and working in a particular way, I think so far we have been fortunate, but I also think it comes off much easier if there are 25 people doing things one way and one person joins. And we are also, to be honest, a little bit conscious about this. When we select people, we try to evaluate of course their academic capabilities, but it\\'s also important in a place like this that their personality should not be, you know, aggressive. So you don\\'t want to have people who are very aggressive and have very strong different points of view. I mean different points of view in a constructive way are good, but in an aggressive and abrasive way are not. So we are, to the extent that you can judge this when you meet somebody for a short time, we are conscious about this. And right now for instance, we need to get some new adjunct people. And the same thing we would like to make sure that, you know, the administration is small, but it works because everybody is willing to do many things. You can\\'t say my job will account, so I will not write a letter because that person is on leave today, you wait till tomorrow. That kind of attitude will not work in a place like this. So we have been consciously telling them, I mean when we, I think, conducted interviews, we made it very clear. The job description is X, but you will have to have some willingness to fill in and spend time. So it\\'s a matter of, I guess, there is some conscious effort, but how much you can control it is difficult. But in a small place, I think, if you don\\'t grow very large, very fast, I think you can do it through some wishious selection. But it\\'s an important point. I think that\\'s something which is not obvious. \\n##Yes, certainly. I think, even among the students. I think, very often students tell you within a few months that the fact that you can actually go to class and ask questions without fearing ridicule from the teacher or from your fellow students. I think that sort of sets in some kind of culture as you say, really rightly. And in this culture, students do point out if there is something that they feel is wrong. And I think this is something we should encourage also. It\\'s not that everything can be addressed. Certainly not. Some things have to be addressed the way we think it should be addressed, not the way students think it should be addressed. But nevertheless the fact they feel that they can approach somebody. I think that is something that they probably learn through their peers. The peers tell them, yes, you can actually talk to faculty. They are approachable. And this is something we do try and, we will try and keep up. Numbers are increasing. But nevertheless, we all feel very strongly that it should be a place where everybody feels that there is a personal involvement that is needed for it to sustain the way that you would like it to be sustained. You have seen the institute a certain way. Do you want it to continue that way? Yes. If you want to continue it that way, then I think the fact that everybody feels responsible for it. This should be something that everybody should strive to maintain. And we do try it and touch wood, it will continue that way. \\n##So one thing I think I would like to point out is that we did see in the student population a bigger variation in attitudes and behaviours this academic year because of the fact that, there was a discontinuity. See, normally otherwise a student population joins but there is enough of population which has already been there. So the culture of this thing gets propagated much more naturally. Whereas now almost everybody who, I think everybody who don\\'t feel like, so those who are already CMI alumni who rejoined from August 2020 after two years of COVID were new students. So they were all thrown in at different levels, first year, second year, third year, but all were equally unfamiliar with how CMI operates. So some of it was just basic things like how do you get the music club started or whatever. But some of it is, we have been seeing some more, I would say, issues with interpersonal relations and some. So we are hoping that it will stabilize but again fortunately the population is not so large. So the number of such issues are relatively small but I think that it is noticeable to us that we have had to intervene more in such questions. And I think that makes it important that you actually, this has to be a sustained thing. If you have any interruptions, there is a big danger that it will go haywire. And considering the student population of course I think we do not have that much control over everyone. Faculty hiring we can control because we do have a choice. But students who do well in the exam, we are not going to do a personality test. \\n##Yeah, this question is coming from the community side. So we are also scaling that we are seeing this kind of cultured new persons, new employees coming. They have a different attitude and all these kinds of things. So we also discussed among ourselves how to maintain this culture. \\n##So here I think the alumni can play a really big role I think. \\n##how? \\n## And how, I think because \\'A\\', you know us very well. A lot of you know us very well. And a lot of you knew know what the culture of the institute. So I think just more frequent interaction with the student group would probably help. Because they would also realize that, you see a certain stake in the institute. Not for personal gains. You have evolved through the system and you have a connection to the system. And if that connect, we try to of course pass it on to the students. But if it comes to the alumni, it\\'s probably a little more natural I think. That students would recognize that look at some point they were like us. And they still feel the connect. So probably there is, so attitudes can be, I mean you don\\'t require much change in attitude. Just a little nudge here and a little nudge there. \\n##15 minutes. 15 minutes. Just take another 15 minutes. It\\'s okay? \\n##Sure sir, no problem.\\n##Just a little nudge here and a little nudge there. I think it\\'s enough. We are not talking about ways of changing attitudes. I mean people just don\\'t have to rigidify themselves in certain ways. And I think here the alumni can play a very crucial role.\\n##Maybe this is one of the reasons I keep coming here. And in fact, today I talked to the other alumni and I think they are also interested. \\n##Definitely. I think that is something. \\n##In fact, there is a group who are interested in. \\n##Yeah. I mean I\\'m hoping that if this next year will be a little... I mean there will be people who have spent a year and they are kind of imbibing this culture. So the new students joining will have a better sense of what to expect. But yeah, any such positive feedback from alumni, I think we are going the wrong way. \\n##And to that, when I come here, I meet all the juniors, seniors, in fact, BSc. This day I meet some random person and asked \"How are all things going?\". So I found they were saying this-that they came here after COVID and they are still struggling. \\n##Yeah, we do see that. I mean some students, in fact, the student who wants to meet me has a case. So some abstract cases, \"I\\'m not doing well I wanted to you about this.\" So I sense that. And I think it will take some time. And these are things that we cannot also fully understand ourselves. So we can talk them through it and hope that they can solve these issues themselves.\\n##Maybe when I do this, I can expect that at least my interns, those juniors, maybe they do the same thing as well. I see them over there. \\n##Any plans? So how are you scaling the institute in terms of students and campus? Campus is definitely fine. We can talk about that. \\n##Yeah, so this is of course now again. So I think that compared to maybe roughly 10 years ago. We have been growing the student population in the individual program. And also we have been, I mean we added this data science program which was not there earlier. And the predecessor was a very up and down with applications of math. We started with 20 students which was good, but then it came down to sometimes like 4 students. So for a while I think we were thinking actively in terms of even for projecting for outside support, in terms of scaling the teaching program by having more students. But there are many infrastructural issues with that. One is that I mean, having gone to slightly larger class sizes, the BSc batch which graduated in 2022 was our largest ever. It was 60 plus. And also because of some courses being between BSc and MSc CS, so some classes were already crossing 60 plus even before that. We have kind of understood that there is a kind of a natural limit in some sense. You know if you go with class sizes beyond 50-60, then the nature of the teaching is very different. Either you have to put double the works between the intersections. Or you have to accept that the kind of education and the kind of student-faculty interaction will be very different, which we don\\'t want. So I think that currently, the other thing is that, the way the public perception is, when people say you should scale up your teaching, they don\\'t mean scale it up like double, they mean like scale it up to 5000-10,000, which is a different kind of institution. So in that sense, though we are a deemed university, I don\\'t think we should and can claim to be a university in the sense of that scale. So I think we should try to stick to what we are good at, which is within a limited domain, do some high quality teaching for a reasonable group. I mean we have enough at least evidence to go back and say that we have placed so many people in good institutions and in good jobs, so that we have had an impact. But I think what we are really now trying with this new land and this new thing is to, I think, revisit our impact in research. So, of course we have had a very successful program so far in terms of purely academic research, which is mainly through publishing papers and conferences and all that. But I think increasingly one needs to diversify that also. And I don\\'t think that we can, because of limitations of other resources, just like we cannot increase the student population arbitrarily, we cannot also arbitrarily increase the faculty. So if we have over 35-40 now, maybe 50 is the most that we can sustain without getting into, I mean to keep it in the sweet spot of being a sustainable size. So we cannot hope to cover too many new areas in that. But we should also, that\\'s why we started a center where we can support a lot of external visitors, who will also interact with our faculty and students, but also be part of a larger contribution to the research community in India, Chennai in particular. I think that\\'s what we really want to look at now, that too. So CMI has a certain visibility, as we have discussed, within a certain group of academics. Through the Data Science program, we have acquired a different type of visibility amongst the industry community. Now we need to somehow broaden this impact and get CMI to a place where it\\'s recognized, it\\'s small in physical size and absolute numbers, but its impact is large enough that it\\'s not difficult to get people to support you, and it has activities which make it stand out. I think so ultimately, Seshadri\\'s goal was to build a kind of institution of world eminence. I think you can be an institution of world eminence without being huge. So I don\\'t think that we want to become huge, because that\\'s not, I think, that will change everything, and it will be a very different kind of institution. So I think we want to keep this kind of family atmosphere, but at the same time, be as impactful as possible. So therefore, I think one way is to increase our interaction with external people beyond what we are doing now, to have a sustained flow of people coming and going and new ideas, but at the same time, not strain our infrastructure too much, so we don\\'t have permanent commitments with this kind of thing, so people come and go, if there\\'s some difficult person, we can not invite them.\\n##Then that sweet spot will be gone.\\n##So that\\'s the key now. So I think our current thinking is that how to maximize the impact without changing. See, also changing what is working is also something, you know... So to an extent, the teaching program is working, and we know we are stretched it a little bit, so we know it\\'s limitation. So I think we are happy with this program, and there is no, other than satisfying somebody else\\'s requirement, there is no immediate need for us, we don\\'t see a need to have more students of this type or that type. We want to continue to have good students, but the number is not important to us, if there are 50 data science students or 75 data science students, it\\'s not important to us to get 25 more. Whereas it is important to us to keep the quality of the interaction the same. So I think that way we are happy to keep some things as they are, or keep them in roughly the same way, and try to expand it. \\n##So now we are coming to an end. So we started with the \\'dream\\' and \\'plan\\' idea. So how do we are doing all that dream? Are we sticking to that dream we created or we are on that same path? How we are achieving that?\\n##Yeah, so since as I mentioned before the dream was a little bit abstract. I think, we are doing well in the sense that the dream was to have a combination of high quality research and high quality teaching. And I think we are very much on track and we have done well and I think we are continuing to do so. Perhaps what was not very clear in the beginning was, what should be the scope of this. So for instance, I know that Seshadri with his interest in music was very keen that we should have a strong humanities program. But then that brings in some sense an unsustainable breadth. Like, to hire or these students you have to take. So I think there possibly we will not achieve. I think that it\\'s not realistic to think of that. But within the narrower scope of mathematical sciences, I think we are expanding in the sense that applications of these things, one example being Data Science, is now almost kind of limitless. And there is a lot of other institutions like CMI who are involved in mathematics who are looking to expand into things. I mean for example modeling climate or thanks to pandemic you know public health. So I think that way staying within this our competence but having an impact. Even government, e-governance as they call it. So I think we can have without getting into new areas which we don\\'t have any expertise in, we can still stay within what we are doing and develop a wider footprint. So I think in that sense, I would say that we are still on track. But maybe the details of the goal have become a little more sharp. \\n##So that was initially the idea and now the implementation part. So definitely yes. \\n##And I think through this FC Kohli Centre hopefully we will have, as Madhavan said, the idea is to have multiple thematic programs and so on. But the thematic programs like as we understand it are mostly mathematical. I mean you could potentially bring in other kinds of subjects also. But in a limited way. But if you do it every year, year on year, then I think there will be a natural impact in that direction in those axes also. So that is another way to look at it. Like we started with the CMI Arts Initiative. And at this point it is well known. So perhaps one could think about doing those kinds of activities also through the FC Kohli Centre. That is a possibility. Where we reach out to say, like Seshadri always wanted to play music, create a humanities program. But we could potentially have some really top notch humanities programs as part of that. That is something that one could still dream about. Hopefully at the end, if we are able to make an impact to a larger body of student community and faculty across the country, which we hope to do through the FC Kohli Centre. Because we want to really keep this as a centre where you would have people coming from faculty members from other institutes also participating as enthusiasts. Because we would like them to do. So they also see, they also feel that they can actually participate in these activities. And enjoy the fruits of the centre of this kind. And also sort of enlarge the student body that is being trained. I think we would get closer to that dream.\\n##I just wanted to add one more thing. We were talking about scaling the teaching program. So what does scaling the teaching program hope to achieve? I mean obviously the hope is to build a larger pool of manpower. But what we are now thinking that, this larger pool of manpower can be through different avenues. So one of them is if we have this visiting program at the FC Kohli Centre, we will hope to invite. So we are training people at bachelor\\'s, master\\'s level, but there are a number of PhD students. And we hope that PhD students of course will increase as we get more faculty. But through this we can also make it possible for PhD students and Postdocs  from other institutions to come and expand there. But the other thing which I want to mention are about the two things, one, we are hoping to set up some kind of a mathematics museum or an Experience Centre. So we have set aside some space there. So a kind of an exhibit where it\\'s not to see photos of a mathematician. But to come and actually interact with some maybe some physical models or see some simulations or something. So to get school and college children enthusiastic about pursuing mathematics. Now as KV said the good thing we have now is that CMI is not paying this only. There are lots of institutions in the country which are starting programs like this. So if we can drive people indirectly to these programs, we can\\'t absorb all of that. But if we can drive people to these programs by giving them some kind of enthusiasm for mathematics. I think that is also... So we are not in that sense. Expanding the teaching program is one way to do it. But I think we can have an equally large impact by doing things in different dimensions. So I think it\\'s not only our research I\\'m saying that is coming out of that. I think it\\'s also going to have this impact in terms of capacity for more people taking to mathematics.\\n##One of their questions I think I missed. So why did you start a Data Science course? What motivated you to start that course? And in future will there be any other similar courses? \\n##So this specifically we have already started this Application of Math course with an idea that we should be contributing people with mathematical background to make this. Now that course was a little bit ambitiously pitched at multiple aspects, including finance which required a stronger math background. So we found that somehow it was not, we were not getting the right pool of students or we were tapping into too narrow a pool of students. Then we had some plans along this line but we actually got a UGC review committee which recommended why don\\'t you refocus this thing looking only at the analytics part. So it was partly justified by their motivation although we had already been thinking about this. So that\\'s how we came and then we said okay if we are going to do this then let us rethink the whole target audience. And instead of looking for people who already know this stuff looking only for people with math and stats background, try to make it accessible to a broad spectrum. Because also there will be obviously some programming and this component to it. So look for people either from this background or from engineering background and try to have a bridge at the level of it. So in a sense it came from our failed experimental Applications of Math. Trying to ask ourselves because we had already started through AlgoLabs, some training programs in machine learning for industry and we could see that there is a demand for this coming up. And then restructuring and training was a consequence of our trying to understand where can we go. It was a bit fortunate that our restructuring seemed to have hit the right balance but it was definitely motivated by our failed experiments. So it was not out of the blue in that sense. And more yeah, there are always questions about more such domains, for example people have been talking about cryptography or you know even things related to biology and bioinformatics. But I think \\'A\\' we need to have critical core expertise in that and secondly I think it\\'s not convincing that there is a demand which requires a new program to be started by us. I mean we can push people in that direction but if there are already programs then that should be expected to support them, rather than to undertake our own program. But if something comes up, yes. So when we said we are not going to start, have more students, I meant it in the sense of existing program. But if there is a clear need for a new type of program, we are open to that. \\n##So last two questions. At the end what should parents and students expect from CMI? These are students\\' parents. \\n##So I think that they should expect from CMI, of course as KV said , the most important thing that they should expect from CMI is an institution which cares for them. So that we are small enough and we are personalized enough that we will treat every student as an individual and try to bring out. So of course from the professional point of view we are trying to get them to achieve whatever it is that they are interested in, get them to achieve their maximum potential. So I think that is what, but what parents should be conscious about is that it is not like dealing with a very nameless and impersonal large institution. That if there are specific needs or specific concerns, we are there to help. And on the other hand if there are specific abilities, we are there to help. So I think that is what they should be aware of. \\n##Yeah, absolutely. I think, and the other thing that, personalized experience is something that certainly we would like to deliver. Whether we will be able to deliver it always and to most students, I don\\'t know, but we do try. And the other thing that I think parents should realize is that, I think when students come in and they have a certain passion, I think when they leave, if they have the same passion, may not be for what they came in for, but if they realize that there is a certain passion and I can pursue this passion in a different direction, that also is good. I think so long as you don\\'t kill passion, I think we will be doing fine. Whether it is passion for mathematics, passion for physics, passion for computer science, or passion for doing something else. Yeah, if the kind of passion that I think most faculty members have in their pursuits, that comes on to students. I think we will be doing well. And I think that will help. So parents can expect that their child will come in with a certain passion, but might go on with a different passion. It is perfectly fine, so long as there is passion in the end. \\n##Last question. How will you stay up to date with the latest development in your field? And how will you involve students in those areas? \\n##So of course, one of the reasons that Seshadri insisted that they should be active in their own field of research. So for now, still our hiring and our promotions in faculty are only on research. So therefore it is imperative for faculty to stay current in whatever they are doing by interacting with their peers. And therefore a lot of it happens just through the normal process of being a research level in mathematics or computer science. You keep abreast because you are looking at problems which are of current interest and you are interacting with peers. But of course there is also an aspect of looking at new things. So some of it comes from the community. Community starts, like for example, even within computer science, I come from a verification community. But verification is, some people are trying to see machine learning ideas and be adopted and so on. So there is a natural inflow and sometimes you get interested enough in that, you might even change your focus a little bit. But I think largely it is the fact that this is still our defining role. It is still to be a research scientist. And teaching is not there. Teaching is in some sense a by-product. And then I think it is intangible, but I think when you teach from this perspective, you tend to also make remarks or comments or observations on what is otherwise routine in a way which connects it to other things. So students also, when attending this course, they think that course, here a comment here, it connects to there. It also expands their understanding. And then they come and ask us, I would like to do some reading in this or I would like to do a master\\'s thesis in that. And that is how they kind of get an opportunity. And that way this personalised thing, you know, so most likely if somebody comes with a specific request and it is aligned to something, they would normally be amenable to doing this. So I think that, but the main thing is that it is crucial I think that this, there is no, nobody is hired in CIMI to teach. They are all hired to stay active in research. And I think that makes the difference. Any final comments? Tell me. I will start with you. I am glad that we are actually doing this because I think we have always met from there. It will be very nice to record these things. And yeah, so that way I am so new on the first batch because I knew recently very well. And I just hope that other alumni also get as involved I think. I think that is very important. It is good for older people like us to see youngsters like you come back. That is very important. I think that is, it is always nice to find an alumni who have gone on, done very well for themselves. It is sort of, it is gratifying for me of course as an individual. But also the fact that the institute building was not a waste. You have actually generated people who, you have produced people who have as much of a passion for the institute as you have. And I think that is very, very essential. I think, I just hope that people will come forward like this, that you have. And also we have planned certain activities around the alumni conferences. So let us hope that this is some way to sustain the sort of enthusiasm for the institute. Yeah, I certainly second that. So I think that we recently, couple of times, I have had, been talking to people who are interested in supporting CMI. So I think one of the things that I have pointed out is that CMI\\'s greatest asset is not this land or this campus or the buildings, but it is the people. So you cannot build a faculty like this overnight. So no matter how much money you pour into an institution, getting the right people and sustaining that and getting new people is the hardest. And similarly, so I think our greatest asset is certainly the people who work here. But our greatest achievement, I think, is the alumni benefits. So I think they are our greatest advertisement. And I just hope that all of you continue to spread the word. And of course, the new batches will also join the ranks and do as well. As KV said, there is no greater satisfaction. Definitely. And in fact, this story and this will boom outside. We will create a story out of this. On your visual format. This will go on. And maybe we will have a future. Certainly. Because it has given a lot of, what was it behind that? What was the dream and from the dream, where? And sometimes when you are in the middle of it, it is hard to analyze the dream. But in retrospect, you can kind of, maybe it is also a fake story in the sense that it is a bitter story to what happened. But I think a lot of it has reality. I think there was a certain direction and a lot of luck. I think there is no doubt. A lot of things have happened at the right time. And that is helping. Okay. Thank you. Thank you.\\n\\n ##I want to say that the different part of the world and in India like, students are given a lot of freedom. And two of the most tough issues like mental health issues and LGBT issues, they are given, they are dealt very well in CMI. Like, they have a counsellor coming every week. And then people from LGBT community, they are not afraid to express themselves here. \\n ##So, how did CMI manage to adapt to that, like this culture and... \\n ##See, that is I think hard to quantify. I think it is possibly just again a coincidence or a thing that the people who were cured from, I mean, when the issues come up, of course, they have to be addressed. But I think the people who have, there were enough people who were sensitive to the need to address it and to come up with, especially the mental health part of it, the fact that we need some, means not just a, you can wish away, that you need some professional support and all that. And in terms of, I think, we have always, because one thing about CMI is, both the faculty and the students are from very different backgrounds, even within each community. So, it is very clear that people come from very different backgrounds. So, there has never been, I think, a fixed mindset that everybody should think that way or this way or that way. So, inclusiveness in that sense, I think, is part of the fact that we all possibly have fairly different cultural backgrounds and therefore we are possibly more happy. But I do not think it is something which, I think it is more fortunate thing among the people who are here that there are enough people who are sensitive to these things and most people are not unhelpful. I mean, it is of that. If the few people who are active take an interest and do something, the other people are not put as a risk. So, that I think is, we are possibly lucky that we have that kind of community. But certainly the fact that there are a few people who are willing to step up and address these issues is very important and we do have those people. So, possibly not, they were not chosen based on those attributes, but it is fortunate that we have them. Yeah, so, I do believe there is a culture of inclusiveness. Now, why that happened and how that happened, I think probably because I think we are, I mean, actually I do believe that we are not very judgmental about people. I think, we do believe that people have the freedom to do what they want and I think majority of us feel so. Now, we may not all agree on all the issues, of course, that is impossible. But I think the fact that I don\\'t judge you also helps, I think. And whether, and I don\\'t judge you whether you do well in academics or you don\\'t do well in academics. Yeah, if you are still here, you are good. Maybe this is not your cup of tea, which is perfectly fine. You will find something else. I think that probably helps and I think, again, we were very lucky in getting the kind of schools we got, who were also very sensitive to these issues, who also were probably not very judgmental. Let\\'s hope it continues. Let\\'s hope that happens. Thank you. Thank you.\\n So, I think when you start a new program, the first problem usually is credibility right. So, the students have to be aware and have to and parents also have to be convinced that somehow this program will meet some quality expectation and will have that. So, in that sense having Tejasvi and others who came from the IMO joining did two things. One is of course, they were clearly choosing something which was relevant to their background and so for any student interested in mathematics, IMO was already established as a standard. And also within the student community especially the maths Olympiad community which was the main community at that time of students interested in maths outside school level, they also tended to follow what the senior students were doing. So, I think it was quite important step that we managed to get these two, I think Debapriyo from the first batch was also from the camp. But Tejasvi was not just from the camp, he was actually a rare case of an Indian gold medalist at IMO. So, that really helped to build that credibility and therefore, we never had an issue in that sense although of course, the number of students joining was always small in the first few years, but at least nobody had any doubts about whether those who were committed to it would get a good quality education. So, I think to build up that initial brand I think it was very important to have them.\\n No, certainly I mean now see it takes a while also because the number of students graduating from CMI is quite small. So in fact, when we first thought of the alumni association in after coming to this campus around 2010-11 about 10 years ago, our total alumni strength was still less than 500. So in that sense, if the number of students who is outside is small, obviously only those they come into contact with. But certainly through our alumni now we see a lot of institutions and organizations which are aware of CMI. So therefore, even though they may not be in a position like, you know, IIT has this fortunate thing that they have alumni from many years ago and some or several of them have been successful in the IT industry and they have been able to, you know, personally make a lot of money so that they are able to donate back. So in that kind of literal sense, they can contribute to the institution directly. But I think indirectly the fact that our students are doing well wherever they have gone, both in academia and now more recently through the last 3-4 years in industry also. I think awareness about CMI spreads much faster when it comes from people like our alumni who interact with more people because what we say and do is restricted to the people we know. And as you know, we are not terribly aggressive about publicity and these kind of things. So I think word of mouth and the fact that they are doing well and they are appreciated, obviously then people want to know where do these students come from and can we find more such talent in the future and so on. So that has certainly helped. So my question is regarding physics. So by the name it is a mathematical registration. So how does this BSc Physics course start? So in, of course historically if you look back at the growth of say even 20th century, lot of the mathematics and physics have grown together. So a lot of theoretical physics in the early part of the 20th century benefited from advances in mathematics, even Einstein and all these people. So in that sense there has always been a close link between mathematics and physics. So the idea that pure mathematics is separate from physics is a relatively modern idea. And so even computer science being considered an aspect of mathematics is relatively new. I mean till even few decades back most people thought of computing as more on something to do with electronics and engineering rather than to do with the mathematical side of computing. So now when you say mathematics you could either interpret it in this very narrow fashion or you could look at a wider thing. So computer science had already been accepted fortunately by Seshadri when he started the institution as a valid thing. And in a place like TIFR or IIMSC there are strong theoretical physics groups. So the Institute of Mathematical Sciences is also by name an institute of mathematics but actually has majority of the people in any one given discipline is in physics. So that way moving into physics was not unusual idea. And at some point, so there was a senior colleague Professor Rajasekaran from IIMSC who was keen to do this and Professor Seshadri was also open to this idea. So that is how the physics group started. And then once the physics group start and you start looking for, by that time the teaching program was already there. It is different from maybe pre-teaching program where you can start a research group but have no connection to teaching. But now that there is already a teaching program and then you want to expand by hiring people in a new discipline. It makes sense to ask whether there should be some corresponding outlet for them to teach students in their area. Because otherwise just doing research is not what CMI wanted to do. So in a way it was, I mean the two things went hand in hand. The decision to expand into physics was connected to the fact that physics, theoretical physics is very close to, tied to mathematics. And then once you start that group then it makes sense to start a teaching program in that group. So the work that we do in CMI regarding mathematics, it is regarded globally actually. So how does it, it is there in our physics department? How is the work going on in physics department? So the physics department of course is much smaller both in terms of the number of faculty members because there are only at the moment 6 or 7 of them compared to 15 to 20 in the other two disciplines. And the number of students also who are studying at the bachelor\\'s level is comparatively small. So that way the visibility is probably less in absolute terms. But in terms of the professional visibility, that is the faculty members themselves I think are equally respected and equally prominent in their own disciplines as the other people in mathematics and computer science. So the activity is less because there are fewer in number. And their international standing is no less. As you know we have one person, Professor Arun who has been working on this gravitational waves. And so his work has been highly recognized. We have 2 or 3 people working in string theory which is one of the big areas in theoretical physics. And they are very much a part of both the Indian and international string theory community. So like this I think there is no qualitative difference. It is just the numbers are smaller in physics. So one more question. Like this regarding application of mathematics. So that was, how does it happen? How does EMR happen to start that process? Why does it end up in this? Okay. So I think some, at some point just like we felt that research alone was not a good enough justification, the institution should also do teaching. At some point we also realized that there is a need for inputs from people with mathematical training in different domains. But there is no institution which is really addressing this need. In many departments in India there are so-called applied mathematics courses. But for various reasons these applied mathematics courses have mostly been tailored towards certain kinds of engineering problem, fluid mechanics and so on. Whereas if you look at domains like finance and insurance and all these where you have mathematical models which are not tied to these kind of very limited engineering type of solutions, there is really no appreciation of that. And the pure mathematics students are also not inclined to look at such problems. So then if you want to serve this need, that is there is a need out there perceived in industry and even in other organized, not just in industry but even in government, in public, I mean if you want to manage water resources or if you want to manage traffic or if you want to do climate modeling, who would do all this? So who, where will you get the people? So that was really the intention of starting a course which is aimed at producing students who have a mathematics background but also have an appreciation of real world problems that can be addressed. But one of the domains which was emphasized at that time because it was becoming quite visible in the news was finance. And so therefore there were two broad streams. So one was this mathematical finance and the other was what is now data science but in those days was called analytics and interpretation of data. Sir, why did it got ended? In 2017, it got ended. Yeah, so as I said there were these two streams, mathematical finance and this data science kind of thing. Now as we have seen the data science program can be approached from many different disciplines. So students can take it up either with a background in mathematics or statistics or coming from computational background in engineering and then pick up the relevant because they would have had some exposure to the basic maths but they can top it up in linear algebra, probability and all that. On the other hand, mathematical finance is a much more specialized topic. The applications, I mean the way in which mathematics is used in finance requires a fairly sophisticated level of mathematics. So it requires topics in stochastic calculus and various other higher level topics. So therefore without a BSc in mathematics, it is very hard to reach that level in a master\\'s program. You cannot start from basics and reach that level within. So then the selection process had to be such that students come from a BSc maths background and I think that was the real difficulty because there were not enough students who were in the system in some sense in our BSc programs across the country who would want to take up such a course. It is more likely that somebody coming from a statistics or a mathematics background would like to take it up but they were ruled out because the entrance exam was geared towards BSc mathematics. And more often the students who came from BSc mathematics for this program were really not that keen on the applied or the application of their thing. They were really looking to pursue higher studies after this. So the purpose of training people to go out and take roles in organizations where they could apply their knowledge was also not being. So and the number also was dwindling because initially we were quite good in the first 2 or 3 years we got 10 to 20 students per batch. But then it was coming down to single digits and even those single digit students were mostly looking at PhD as an option. So we were not really serving any real purpose. So then it was suggested that maybe it might be more useful to focus it on data science and drop the mathematical finance thing as a specialization. Because also by then it was also clear that see the other side of the story is if you look at the finance industry, they do not really expect people to come with a background in mathematical finance because they know there are not that many people there. So they are quite happy to take students from diverse backgrounds including IITs and all that and train them. So they are really looking for people with strong quantitative skills and an ability to learn rather than prior knowledge. So these people who have been trained in math finance were anyway not expected to know that much when the job that they took would retrain them. So we said okay those who want to go for finance can still go for finance because the companies do not need them to learn it in MSc. But if you use, by this time also the world of data science had started becoming much wider and the acceptance of machine learning in various industries had also started. So it seemed a much more useful way to redirect this program. And it has turned out that way. Now we get a very strong demand and we do get students from diverse backgrounds. So we can actually make the entrance exam a little bit more open to wider category of students and also the opportunities are now in a wider domain. So I think overall it has been a good transition and from a very I would say too narrow a program to a much more useful program. So data science program, so if we look in the past like what are the programs like mathematics and computer science, mathematics and physics. So there has been in research for quite some time. And then bachelors and masters program started right. So there is this difference in data science. Like we rarely started a masters program. So why is this difference? So one reason is of course that there was a transition from an existing masters program to this program. So that was part of the reason. So there was already a masters program in applications of maths and we wanted to restructure it as a masters in data science. The other thing is that see data science is even now a little bit undefined. I mean what is data science is not very clear. Because you need to know things from different disciplines. So if you start with a bachelor of data science, then it is a little unclear what level you should put the foundational courses and how much you should make applied courses. So it seems for such kind of subjects which are not yet I think fully mature, it is more useful to start where they already have a background in some more traditional area like maths or statistics or some branch of engineering. And then you can use the fact that students have some base knowledge. And then you can be a little bit more selective about what courses you feed. So really it is more practical. I think that maybe you know I know that some colleges have started bachelor\\'s courses in data science. But I think a lot of them are I think the design is very unclear. And I would say the same thing if you look at computer science I think the same thing is true. I think when I studied computer science which was like now of the order of 40 years ago, the B.Tech programs in CS were very varied. What you studied even across IITs was very different. And it was mostly dictated by how the CS group had grown. So if you look at IIT Bombay for instance where I studied, it was mostly populated by people who had come out from electronics, from the electrical. So we did a lot of hardware courses as part of our B.Tech. Other places they would do a lot more courses related to programming or software. But a lot of it was very, what should I say, very applied. And the idea that there are more fundamental principles and you know more advanced things in computing came much later. So I think that in general this is a thing that if a new discipline becomes part of the curriculum, I think it takes a little while for it to settle down and for people to agree what are the basic things that every data scientist must know. And till you can agree on that, it is very hard to set up an undergraduate program. So it is easier to set up a master\\'s program where your scope is limited but also the damage that you do is limited. I mean if you train a student in a wrong way at bachelors, then it takes much harder to recover. Whereas if they do not learn much in the master\\'s but they already have a decent background in bachelors, it is okay. You can kind of live with that. So from that practical point of view also, a master\\'s is more sensible. So is there an idea like maybe after some years we can start a bachelor\\'s program or a research program? Bachelor\\'s program is probably unlikely. Research program is more aligned to what we would like to do. Because really I think we have been thinking about these things in a general sense. So we started with a very small but focused research group. We moved into teaching. We built up from a very small teaching program to a moderate, I would not even say it is large but it is very small but a moderate size teaching program. Now there are two ways one could go. One could take this teaching program and try to make it large. Or you could as you were suggesting take this teaching program and extend the research in institutions which are closer to the teaching program. Making the teaching program large we feel is not going to be the best way of using our the nature of the character of the institute is right now I think defined by the fact that there is a very close interaction between the faculty and the students driven by the fact that the number of students is relatively small. So it is easier to give individual attention. Now if you start, if you move from 250, 300 students to 3000 students then that becomes a challenge because the student, the classes become very large, faculty do not know the students, it becomes an anonymous thing and also the kind of what the faculty get back from teaching is much less. See if I am just teaching 100 people and there is no feedback then I am just saying the same thing again and again. Whereas if I talk to 50 people and somebody asks a question which makes me think about what I am saying, it will sometimes change the way I have understood something and next time around maybe I will explain it differently. So the whole nature of the teaching is I think at the moment it is a certain style of interaction and growing it will not improve. So we are open to having, if like data science if a new area becomes very important, maybe 10 years from now quantum computing will have a similar flavor, we could consider a master\\'s program for a small group in quantum computing. But taking any existing program and expanding it we are not sure. And similarly this bachelor\\'s in data science, maybe if we find a way of actually understanding what should be taught we could consider it. But right now I think that is still probably 10, 20 years away before people can even agree on what should be taught. But research yes, I think already a few people here through interactions with students who have asked questions about thing and wanting some guidance, but also because we do take on projects with industrial projects and so on. And there are students who are genuinely interested who are even in the computer science group. I think the chances that we will slowly develop a research program in data science is very likely. Is there any more other processing working for this kind of, let us say, so biological changes those kind of, any more we are seeing. So we did seriously think for quite a while we were seriously looking at different applications of mathematics which we could get into. So a few were suggested to us. So one was actuarial sciences which is the insurance industry thing. One was biological sciences. One was something to do more maybe towards economics and this kind of thing. So some of these we explored quite seriously. Actuarial sciences for instance we did discuss with some universities which have programs in this and what we understood from talking to them and also talking to people who are in the industry. See actuarial is a bit like chartered accountancy that the degree is not so important as the certification exam and all actuaries, all people who want to work in insurance have to write this professional actuarial exam. So if you were to teach a master\\'s course or something then essentially you would have to, it will be like a training program for the actuarial exam. People are not very interested in learning theory in an open sense. They want to be, so there would not be much interest for us in doing that. So we dropped that idea. Biological sciences we seriously considered. We even spoke to people at NCBS in Bangalore about the possibility of having some kind of collaboration. See one of the limitations there is that there is no strong institution working in biology in Chennai. So there are of course, Madras University has some few department groups, some research labs and all that, but there is no really like the way it is in Bangalore or Hyderabad where you have NCBS or if you have IISC or in Hyderabad you have the centre for CCMB for molecular biology. So these kind of big scale biology research institutions are not there in Chennai. So there are several things. One is that I think it is hard to just learn mathematical biology or computational biology in isolation without talking to biologists because the way that biologists understand biology is always different from the way that we can model it. So there is a limitation in actual thing, you know, collaborative possibilities. And the other thing is that biology is a very, in itself a very vast subject. So if you want to teach mathematics in a serious way or computer science in a serious way and teach biology in a serious way, it is very hard to combine. And many of the people who are actually working in these areas now at a research level, mathematical or computational biology have actually done their basic training and others, they have come from physics or they have come from mathematics or operations research. So they have learnt the necessary biology when they are there. So all these reasons, we did not start any of these, but we are still looking at a few. I mentioned quantum, but crypto is another question whether, you know, whether there is a, see the other reason why we did not take up this mathematical biology thing is that after asking around, it looks like there are very few opportunities other than pure research. See, we thought that there should be opportunities in industry, but there seem to be very limited opportunities for students after doing something like that in terms of taking up jobs. So then again, it would be counterproductive to start a program and then students have very few options to go after that. So that was one other difficulty. For example, from an activity in terms of research, I mean, something like cryptography, security, these are interesting possibilities. Or I mentioned quantum, but again, all these subjects, they are not well defined enough to construct in our viewpoint, construct a program. So data science, we have sort of realized that it is at the intersection of two or three areas and we have put together something and it seems to be at the moment at least something which people in industry are finding useful. But again, where would the people who study crypto or quantum, where would they go, what kind of skills those people will be expecting from them, that is a little bit unclear right now. So if it becomes a little clearer, then we can walk in that direction or somehow expand the MSc, CS program or something to have specializations. So, these are all possibilities, but at the moment, we are not seriously looking at it because we feel the subjects are not stable at the moment. So, one more question is regarding this collaboration between ISA and CMA. See, whenever you think about the good math, you see the stat institutions in India, when you think about CMA and ISA, there have been some extensions, Sivaji has again last year or so. What is the collaboration and what is the effect each other and has something to do with ISA and CMA? Yeah, so I think that, of course, we have benefited from former ISI people being here including Professor Karanthikar, Professor B. V. Rao, and then we have had people who have taught otherwise also, Professor Alladi, Sitaram and so on. So, a number of people who have been in ISI as faculty have come and taught here. But in terms of active collaboration, there seems to be less, I would say, than one would hope. I am not sure whether this is because of distance or whether it is because of people not having enough common interest to start something. But this is, unfortunately, I mean, so CMA and IIMSC, because people are from very similar areas and also it is physically close by and there is a shared history in some sense, the collaboration is there to a reasonable extent. But in general, if you look at it in India, I think collaborations between Indian institutions is much less than collaborations between institutions in India and institutions abroad. So, I do not know whether this is something to do with the fact that, you know, institutions themselves do not encourage this or whether it is something else. But somehow this inter-institution collaboration in India, not just in this particular instance, but even if you look at across IITs, it is very rare to find somebody from IIT Bombay collaborating with somebody from IIT Delhi or IIT Madras. And so it is a sad situation, unfortunately, and I do not know exactly what is the, I mean, there is some sociological issue there. But, so I am not very sure how to, you know, become a little bit more open in that sense. So, like there are lot of research programs on maths, like many professors are working for that, in that domain. But in data science domain, there are lot of area like in LBA and all that. But I can see some lack of research around that topic, like even though professors are not more in the term of industry, with its industry experience rather than having some research experience. So, are we thinking in that direction? No, definitely. See, that is the real, I mean, the real challenge of starting a research program in any area is that you must have obviously faculty who are research oriented. Now, the unfortunate difficulty is that these people who have PhDs and who have research experience in these topics are in very high demand. And it is not just in CMI, almost all academic institutions are facing this problem that they are in very high demand in industry. And they are much higher pay and also, it is not just pay, it is also the nature of the work. So, if you are working in a big company like Google or Facebook or Amazon, you have access to so much more data than you would in any, even in a big university in the US, forget about Indian universities, plus of course, computational resources. So, many people who have done their PhDs and expecting a certain amount of support in terms of these, this kind of infrastructure, find careers in these companies more attractive. And of course, the salary is also always, in industry is always higher, but that is not the only reason. So, there is a huge challenge finding people who are good in these areas. So, we are looking, but it is not easy to find. And the other difficulty that a place like CMI or any place has is that if you want to start a group, then a young person is hesitant to join because there is nobody else. So, they feel that they would be isolated one side, second side maybe they will have a lot of extra responsibilities to initiate some activities. So, really it would be, so it is not a coincidence that both in mathematics and computer science, we started and took off well in CMI. We had really two senior people in Seshadri and Thyagarajan who came. So, they had already established their kind of record in research. And therefore, people were keen to come and work in such a group. So, in physics also as I said because Professor Rajasekaran from IIMSE was involved, it was a way to start. So, there is no such corresponding senior person. So, if we could get somebody, that would be ideal. But, so it has to therefore now, the only other option is that a few people here who are interested in these subjects, who teach in the data science program and whoever, I mean, so it could be Saurish in statistics or it could be KV or myself in machine learning from computer science. So, if a few of us evolve our research in this direction, so that we build up a small group, it is not very specialized, but doing something, then we could hope to get some young people to join and build up a group like that. So, that is what currently we are hoping to do. But, it is a slow process. So, it is not going to happen, I mean we accept that it is going to take time. But, this is a direction in which we are definitely, I mean if we find good people in these areas, we try to invite them to come and see the place. But, more often than not, this is a shortage of supply. So, also there are like some industry research collaboration between CMI and that could happen like between Macrosoft research and UWM. Yeah, definitely. So, these big companies, so we have tried in the past to work a little bit with Microsoft research, not so much with Google research, which is in India relatively more recent, it only started about just I think a year before COVID it started. So, they have of course opportunities for collaboration, but again at the, till now the reason probably there was less collaboration was because the nature of the research that they were doing is more applied than the kind of research that people are used to doing. But, I think now that as I said people have started embarking in this direction. So, KV does have one collaborator, CMI alumnus Amit Deshpande who is there at Microsoft research. So, they do, they have jointly supervised couple of PhD students who have worked here. So, I think it will happen slowly. Outside these two or three, the other place where we have had some success not in machine learning is with TCS research, which more in terms of verification and software engineering and so on. So, there are only, but Indian industry I think if you look at R&D as you know this kind of research which is more open ended and more academic in style, there are only one or two companies like this which are actually doing this. Other people, for other people research is usually I mean in name, but they are very focused on some very short term goals for their own company. So, that and their frustration is that you will start doing something and then for two or three months later even before you have really got started they will have cancelled the project saying that this is no longer of interest to us. So, it is very hard to engage with such organizations.\\n## So, any other I mean apart from food or lodging any other concerns were there that institute is small and the parents were they convinced that they are sending to this institute, to this small institute, what will happen when they will come out or something like that? \\n## Yes that concern was there then and is there today also, I mean what will they do after doing mathematics, what job will they get that is there even today. As per the size of the institute I think it did not matter because the batch sizes were also very small, relatively small like 6 students, 10 students. and the 4th batch was relatively large the BSc 4th batch. Even then I think the students the parents were not looking at the size of the institute and then they saw that all of us including from Seshadri to top to bottom all of us were sort of friendly and accommodative. So, they were convinced that it is a good place. One challenge that we had was library books, books as today it is it was not available as pirated PDF versions or PDF versions or even Indian editions most of the books were not available in Indian edition. So, even a simple book like the Artin or Apostle book will cost like about a 5000 rupees. So, this is something a student cannot buy, even today it is hard for a student to buy something like that and these are classic books and foundational books which every student has to have. So, at that point of time we actually bought. So, initially the class size was just 6. So, we bought 6 copies of Apostle, 6 copies of Artin and so on and later on of course, we realized that we cannot keep on increasing the number of books as students increase. So, of course, they had to you know share the books and things like that and the institute used to close at 5 o\\'clock which was a big disadvantage and nobody had heard of keeping the place open after office hours, especially the library everything used to be closed and this was a commercial building. So, it was probably not even safe for the kids to be there after certain hours, nobody will be there to be deserted completely. So, slowly we overcame all that and try to keep it open after office hours for 2 hours, 3 hours and slowly we moved. We also expanded by occupying more rooms in that same commercial building, slowly we added more lecture halls. We were on the 4th floor and then we moved occupied more of 4th floor, then we occupied 2nd floor, then we also occupied part of the terrace. So, it was like you know colonizing in some sense. After moving here of course, things have been very different. So, once the initial year I mean it went through, so now when we say I moved here. So, what were the challenges you faced when we scaled up a little bit? So, yeah. So, first thing is of course, after moving here, when we moved here in 2005 October, the hostel was not ready, only the part of the academic block was ready. So, it was up till this computer room, computer lab only that much part was there, this portion was not there at all. So, there was no separate library for example. So, and the building was half I mean not I would not say half, but it was not completely ready, about 10 percent of work was still pending, but we had to move because we had given notice at that place. So, we had to transport everybody to this campus, not just students of course, we all were staying in those parts. So, teaching staff, non-teaching staff and students because students were still living in T Nagar. So, we had this two buses, the huge buses know that software buses that you see today. So, we had this two huge buses which used to bring people to CMI and food was a problem again, there was no mess. So, the area that you see behind lecture hall 2, there is a cordoned off area know, I do not know if you have noticed that it has little fruit garden now. That place had a temporary shed and that is where food used to be served, we had a through some contacts we got somebody who will cater food here. So, morning breakfast and lunch and in between some tea, coffee it was served in that place. So, food used to be very bad, the catered food, but we all used to eat because we used to start from T Nagar at 7.30 in the morning including students. So, we will be hungry. So, we just used to eat whatever is available here. So, that was one problem that is logistics and of course, food. Second thing is out there it was a small place and then there were only some three computers or four computers for everybody to use other than the computer lab. For the teaching and non-teaching staff, we had some three or four computers. Since the place was small, we could just walk over and check our email or whatever and print and all that and come back, but here it is little you know bigger place. So, you know our offices are like individual offices. So, we had a few computers sitting in the admin office and we did not have proper furniture, we had all this furniture that you see today in the admin offices was came later. So, we had this table and chairs that we had brought from there. So, we had few table and chairs on which some computers used to sit and people used to come and check their email or print things or whatever. So, for a long time it was like that and what else was there specifically. Then there is a usual teething problems right something will leak and that year it rained a lot October.\\n## Yeah. So, this question is from the perspective of facility and the students problem and any other. So, students I would think they did not have. Because now a days students also increase. Yeah. So, what are the facility challenges in the. \\n##Actually no because we had enough lecture halls here sufficient lecture halls and you must remember that those days technology was not so advanced. So, we did not need anything more than you know a blackboard and chalk and table whatever it is. So, things were going on smoothly actually, but as I said we had more lecture halls than we needed when we moved. So, some lecture halls where we made the board blackboard and all ready before we moved in and some of some of the other things we actually came and the work was going on while we were here. Because we did not need so many classrooms. So, I think we managed pretty well and overall there were no complaints from the students. Then about admissions during admissions right now we do the admissions here in this campus. We ask you all to come here to for the admissions on the admission day, but in those days nobody knew about this place. I do not think any auto wala or taxi wala will even bring people here. So, there was a marriage hall opposite old CMI Vani Mahal. Yes, I remember that. So, we rented Vani Mahal for a day and everybody we asked them to come there the students new students ask them to come there for admissions. \\n##So, they came there and they come with their parents and as usual parents are anxious because some marriage hall mein admission chal raha hai what is going on you know kind of a thing. And then from there we used to bring all the kids here to this campus in shuttles and the distance is quite a lot. Now it is does not seem so, but those days it used quite a lot and they will come with luggage and we would not the shuttle that we used to have sometimes we will not be able to hold that much luggage and kids and all of us. And we used to fill everybody inside because we cannot make one more trip come here and go back and make one more trip that was not possible. So, I think we had two such tempo drivers and we used those to bring everybody here. This I think went on for couple of years then I think we this place was not so, remote. So, then we started having admissions here itself. \\n##So, when you see now from then and now. So, what changes I mean are you satisfied with the kind of things which started there I mean the students problem fascinatingly is I mean the parents apprehension about the same. Now what you see a difference in that what parents think now about the same way before sending their kids to the same way is still the same thing or. \\n##No it has changed quite a lot I think it is mostly because of internet perhaps because the parents can sit at home and see what is CMI about why should you do mathematics I mean the kid can also convince the parent why I should do mathematics or why I should go to CMI and not ISI or not IIT. The kid can show them various things on the internet and convince them still there are a few parents who have doubts and a change you are asking a major change is accessibility. So, now there is more accessibility in terms of travel and in terms of money. So, quite a few people parents and the kid they come and look at our campus once they get admission they come here and try to meet a few of us try to look around and see what we are and they do it for every institute. So, that has changed in the earlier days no parent would come you know few weeks before the admission and there was no accessibility also there was no money I would think to come and go make a picnic kind of a trip and go back. So, those things have changed and if you have to come from Kolkata you have to book a train and probably will take two days to come then you have to stay somewhere and you do not know where to stay then check out CMI go back just probably too much of a hassle. \\n##Now what is the idea of this? \\n##Yeah it has started maybe 10 years ago people come and take a look and go there are others who sometimes are coming this side some parent on work or maybe on some tour South India tour or something then they try to drop in and see what we are about. So, that has definitely changed and parents also know that doing mathematics is something useful it is not that you get only a teaching job in a school it is different perception has changed definitely. \\n##And what would you say to the parents of the student and in future those who want to join CMI to convince them that this place is good what should they expect from CMI? \\n##So, I never try to convince a parent that they the kid should join CMI because that is a decision that the candidate has to make. So, mostly I talk to the candidate who has come the kid who has come with the parent and try to find out from that kid in front of the parents actually what basically their child wants. And then make it clear to the parent that you know your child wants this. So, then they have questions about based on whatever they the child tells them they have some questions about on that which I can clarify that is what I do I we never try to say that this is the best place and you must come here it all depends on the interest of the child who has applied. Once student come here so what their parents should expect from this institution they will get a quality of quality of education and about the facilities they will get whatever they are thinking. \\n##So, we in the admission along with the admission letter we also send a small PDF file telling each student what is available here in terms of hostel what is available inside the hostel and what we have here computer lab library physics lab whatever facilities we have here the shuttles whatever we have we tell them. And it is also clear that this is something very common to everybody over and above that of course, we do not try to promise anything because that is not practical, but after they come here if they have some specific requests and if it is practical we do try to accommodate them. So, I suppose from our the document that we send them with along with the admission letter admission details they know what to expect from CMI should be clear in their mind in terms of facilities. \\n##After students they graduate from CMI so how they feel I mean how they feel about CMI I mean their expectation when they enter and when they are going out their expectation is matched or they came up with some something else, but they got something else and they are happy not happy or they are ultra happy I mean have you got experience of this. \\n##So, I am not entirely about this, but some students do write back to us saying that how they had a very good experience in CMI or even when we meet and talk and all that. And I would think that most people are happy when they go out because lots of them come back here just to visit when they are if they are studying abroad they come back here when they come for a vacation they try to come for a day or two to CMI and I ask them kisli aayo, koi talk de rahe ho kya? Nahi I just came to meet friends and meet everybody. So, that sort of you know gives us so much joy that they are coming and there are others who write to us once in a while or keep in touch via telegram and sometimes our faculty members visit other institutes and our students are there as a student or a faculty member or as a PDF. So, they all enquire about you know each and every aspect of CMI about the people of CMI. So, considering all that I would think that students are happy when they leave CMI. Of course, it is there are people who have you know given us bad press also some people are very unhappy about some things that is also acceptable we accept it. Yeah, but by and large there have been no complaints about being a student in CMI. \\n##I will have to ask him if he has any complaints. No, I am very happy like from my previous degree previous college this is very different and I like how much like transparent this college like how polite you feel when you are here. So, that image completely unique in CMI. Thank you. Even I have been in ISI. So, like it is not like that. \\n##So, we grew organically from you know from 6 students to 300 plus that I think makes a large difference perhaps. So, we used to be like a family I was telling Sudhir yesterday that people used to students used to drop in at our home just like that or we will just we will be roaming around outside and we will meet some students. Then every passing out batch we used to go out for dinner with them take them out for dinner and in return the passing out batch used to take us out for dinner which is you know which is expensive for the students right. Yeah, though we used to say nahi karo it is not necessary they used to do it, but slowly the batches became much bigger and the student size is much bigger. So, I do not know every student now by name or by face like the initial days. So, as you get larger things do change in that sense, but our behavior towards students will not change and our students also they reciprocate in the same manner. So, we are very happy about that finally, students are our assets. Yeah. Yeah. So, without them there is no point in having a CMI. \\n##Now, the future thing is any comments or any message for the future students and parents for both of them. What students should expect, what parents should expect or any other comments. \\n##This is little harder to say about expectations. So, in terms of I would think the facilities we have of course, upgraded ourselves and kept ourselves with the latest like having Wi-Fi everywhere is one of those things. And I do not know what to say about and courses definitely we have added quite a lot of courses in our curriculum from what we used to be then and today. So, we have tried to upgrade ourselves and up keep ourselves updated in terms of the courses that are taught here. I make the time table every semester. So, I know that things have changed so vastly it is very different now. So, I do not know what else expectation wise what to say. \\n##And parents should read whatever it is sent by CMI and everything whatever they are expecting everything is there in that document. \\n##Yeah, it is a short document most people do not read unfortunately. That is why I am wondering. It is a single page document, single page with both sides and it is in bullet points like 1, 2, 3, 4, Ã¢Â€Â¦. There is no large long explanation about anything because it is not necessary. We say room is twin sharing, what do you have to explain in this? Washing machines are there, what do you expect? So, people do not read still they keep asking. Everybody asks is there AC there? No, there is no AC. It is very hot there. Yes, it is hot. So, perhaps these things will not change expectations if the parents expect that their child should stay in an AC environment that is not going to change. Food wise things have changed tremendously. I remember the food that used to be served when the caterer was there. After that we had Sajji who is our current caterer. He earlier was an employee of a company and he used to try very hard to keep the food standard good. It was good. In recent years, maybe 4 years ago he floated his own company and now we have him as a contractor. Food quality has improved tremendously because everything is in his hands. Sports facilities of course we have added whatever we can and there is limited space that we have.\\n\\n ##So, in CMI who were the initial students and why they joined CMI, what motivated them to join CMI? \\n##Okay, so I can speak for myself maybe, but we were 6 students in the first batch, I joined because I was interested in ISI and I could not join ISI that year, so I thought I will come to CMI and study for ISI, that is actually why I came to CMI. But then I met people who, 3 people in my batch, were Olympiad students, one guy joined IIT Madras, he is an IMO gold medalist, he came to CMI, another guy actually, Tejasvi, another person Devapriya Bajendar, he got admission to ISI but then came to CMI, so it was clear to me that I did not know anything about CMI, but I understood that CMI is a non-trivial place and these people who have chosen to come here, so I decided to stay back, I mean I decided to stay in CMI and not worry about ISI. And others, there is Bhaskar who was my batch mate, he came more or less like me, I think he was interested in Maths and he got the exam, I do not know how much he learnt, but lot of people in the first few years, Tejasvi coming was a big factor because he was well known as a gold medalist and people knew him in the Olympiad circles, so after he came I think lot of people felt that this is some, it is a good place where Tejasvi goes, so we can surely go there, it must be good for Maths, so that was the reason for many people, so there were different kinds of, one people who had exposure in Olympiad, who knew from Tejasvi and others, another set of people who like me who I think were interested in Maths and maybe knew about ISI and through that found about CMI. \\n##But at that time CMI did not have any degree, so what was going on in mind of students before joining? \\n##Yeah, so again I have not even thought about it, when I joined, I did not know, for example that CMI does not give its own degrees, I did not know this till I joined or much later, I really it was zero, it played zero impact in my mind, but I guess also importantly in my parents mind, they did not care about this, and obviously whoever came did not think of this as a big issue, I think it was sort of some belief that this is a good place, if you do here, you will be fine, and more than that I think people may be at that time did not worry so much about future, I actually had no idea about what I would do in life, I just wanted to do Maths and I came here, so it was the fact that CMI did not give its own degrees, really did not play a big role, maybe people who knew about it, knew about Seshadri and others, and felt that this is something that is not a big deal, Seshadri is involved in this, it will be fine. ##So, basically you are saying that because of Seshadri Karishma, people started joining. \\n##That must be true for large number of people, some people did not know anything about it, I did not know who Seshadri was or what he does and so on, and for me it seemed like the best option for me among my other options, so I came without worrying about it, but people who knew about it, definitely would have felt that if Seshadri is involved in this, it would be okay. \\n##And what was going on in the mind of parents that their kid is joining a place where the building is also not there, and it is a rented and. \\n##So, I am sure this was a, see this is like a small group that came here, so if you look at those students or their parents, they clearly did not worry about it so much that they did not send their children to CMI, so it is not probably usual, maybe most parents were worried about this, which is in fact true even now, lot of students do not come to CMI because of various uncertainties, and if there are uncertainties now, you can imagine 25 years ago, so the set of parents that actually sent their children to CMI is a very small group and clearly they were different, they did not think about this or they at least did not, I mean they thought about it, but it was not, did not cancel the value they put in CMI, in this education, I think they were worried, but maybe some, they did not worry about it, \\n##So parents were also kind of, they were taking risk by sending their children, I think so, I think parents were taking risk, and they were kind of well read about the Shashadri, that what kind of Shashadri is there, \\n##Yes, I think most parents would have been well read or they were willing to take a chance, if they did not know about Shashadri. \\n##So, that is about the initial years, so now after that in middle of years, which is from 2000, let us say 2002 till 2015, so what has changed in students thinking before joining CMI? \\n##Yeah, so I left CMI in 2003, so I finished my M.Sc. and left, and I joined again in 2011, so this is exactly the period, more or less the period you mentioned, which I was not here, but when I came back, batches were much bigger, I mean there were 25-30 people, and CMI was in a new place, in the current campus, I never was here, so I was in TN, so BMI has a more permanent place and more established record of undergraduate batches graduating, so I think the initial may be concern was not there, and I do not know, I do not think there was too many, so you asked about students attitude, students attitude, I mean I do not know, there is always, it is difficult to compare with generations, I always felt that we were more serious, I think everybody feels this way, our generation was better or they were different, so I do not know, there is not, one difference I noticed is that students are more aware now, because for example as I said earlier, I did not know about my life, I came to CMI because I liked math, and I really had no other option, or rather among the various options, this is best for me, and I never thought about what I would do after B.Sc. or after I do M.Sc., whereas now I think students when they came, they already have a clear plan, and they want to go to this university, they want to do this particular subject, or this particular course they want to study better, so I think that awareness is more, it is good and also bad, because they are so aware and so narrow minded in your interest, then may be you do not explore other things, I think that is a bad thing, on the other hand it is good to be prepared and have a more clear plan in your life, so that is one thing, so that I think is a difference from our time to 2013, people were more aware, they wanted to get specific things out of CMI, they wanted to do certain things, they were aware, other than that I do not know, there is generation difference, it is nothing with CMI specifically, now students have more options, they can do other things, when we were students, we really did not do much, we attended classes, we talked and occasionally went to movies, theaters like in the old times, now students have computers, mobile phones, so they do lot of other things, they do not come to class also, so that kind of thing is very different, so I think in terms of the activities they have in their life, it is very different, we have very few activities. So you are from, you have seen CMI from initial and till now, so the dream with which CMI started and now, so do you see that dream is achieved or we have deviated somewhere in between? \\n##It is definitely achieved, I think one of the dreams may be or goals professionally and other side was to start an undergraduate program and contribute Indian academia and that is really been very successful, beyond that may be dreams, because now we have, so this is the 25th undergraduate batch, now we have CMI graduates in various academic institutions, various companies, various start-ups, so in that way CMI definitely for its size, which is very small if you think about it, like 25, 30 faculty and batch sizes starting from 16 to 40, 50, so the amount of impact CMI had I think is great, so all top institutes if you check, they have CMI alumni as faculty and we have various people working in industry and companies in various kinds of jobs, so in that way yes, CMI dream has been fulfilled and I think in that way I think more will be done, because generally every year we get good students and we have a very active program, undergraduate, masters, PhD, so I think that way dream is definitely alive. And so initially there was kind of problems in getting top talents, because of building was not there, facilities were not there, and now we have building facilities there, so what change you see in the gallery of parents and students from that period and now that period. \\n##Yes, so I think because of the track record, I think more than buildings probably people do not care so much, I think what happens to me after I leave or what happens to my child after he or she graduates from CMI is a legitimate and I think a serious concern for parents, so I think parents are generally happy, so I think there is definitely more willingness to send children here than before, of course CMI is always completed with ISI, so students typically go have option to go to ISI also, so these are sort of comparable places, slight differences which depending on what you want to do you come here or there, but I think there is very few cases of students who want to come here, but do not come here because something in CMI is missing, some people go to IITs, because they want a different thing, they want maybe a bigger campus, they want other kind of career choices, but if somebody is interested in maths, I think they come here, there is no inhibition anymore, whereas maybe 20 years ago people who are interested in maths also were not keen to come here, maybe they are reluctant to go to IIT, now I think that is not the case, I believe most, of course there is issue of the child wanting to do mathematics, but parents are not being interested and that is a negotiation that happens between the child and parent and that has nothing to do with CMI, sometimes child is able to convince the parent, sometimes child is not able to convince, but I think now CMI is established name that parents are willing to send unless they want for some other reason, like IIT or something. How many minutes? \\n##12 minutes. 12 minutes is done, so we have 8 minutes. Yeah, you wanted to ask something. \\n##So you have been from the starting, so do you see any change in this research mentality in students, I can see a lot of students from MSc, not only data science, but other branches are also speaking in placements a lot, do you see any shift in research to investing in placement students? \\n##So definitely that is happening in the very recent past, meaning last 4-5 years, because partly because of the data science program, but partly because the way maybe batch sizes have changed in CMI and that is whatever you said is also true for BSc students, I think it is still true that majority of our BSc students and MSc CS and MSc Math students want to pursue research, I mean want to go at least for PhD, and I think 3-4 generally go, but now because we have much larger batch, we have now 40-50 students, and I think naturally some of them realize after coming here that maybe this is not what I want to do, maybe I want to pursue PhD or academic line, I do not want to be a faculty member, I do not want to be a researcher all my life. So now there is other options for them, and generally my impression is that these people are smart, and they are easily finding options, and they realize that they actually have an asset, and they approach industry. So now that is becoming more, for sure it is becoming, earlier the numbers were tiny or zero in fact, now it is changing, I would say predominantly BSc and undergraduate and MSc CS, MSc Maths people want to do at least PhD, then they sometimes quit and go to industry. Now little more, every batch has small number, but now zero number, who want to pursue, which I think as an institution also we are fine with this, because see now it is easier for them to do, and they are not going to be like, you know, parents which send children, earlier the problem was, what if the child realizes after 3 years that they do not want to do academics, and it was a difficult question, because then of course they can do something, these people are smart, so they can do something. Now we can provide them, in the third year we have electives, in the second year MSc we have electives, so they can switch, and then actually do well. So this has changed, I think this is noticeable. \\n##So how do you see the future of CMI, in terms of scale, top students, talent and faculty? \\n##So, I mean, it is sort of, it is easy to say, it is just continuing the same way, that is an easy answer, and I think that is actually a good answer, because CMIT has been doing well, and we would like to continue in the same direction. May be small increases in size, but actually we are comfortable with the current numbers, like 50 BSc, so 50 plus 50 plus 50 for BSc, 3 batches, and about 50 for data science, and 20 for MSc, Maths and CS. So, I do not anticipate significant change in the students\\' strength. Faculty, we have about 39, close to 40, may be we would like few more, may be reach 50, but, so these are all small increases, so I think broadly we will be at this magnitude for near future, and we would like to continue the same. Research is always going to be the core strength of CMIT, the Maths, CS and Physics research, and of course we do have other options like we discussed, which we want to encourage and we want to keep as an option for our students. So, broadly the same that we are doing should continue, with small changes in the number of faculty and students. \\n##And so, this is the last question from my side. So, you were a student here. Yes. You went outside, then came back here, and you are continuing. So, what motivated you to do CMI, you were 25, but you went there, back and coming here. So, what is the motivation of coming back and continuing here? \\n##Yeah, so coming back of course, I wanted to be in academics, I wanted to be a mathematician and I wanted to come back to India. So, I was in the US and I wanted to come back to India, that is a general personal choice. So, I did try for various places, but CMIT was always something that I loved and I wanted of course to be here. And once I got a job here, I was very happy to come back. And as I said, I wanted to be in academic line and I wanted to come back to India, and CMIT is one of the top places in India. Personally, I have very fond memories of this place and the people here. So, I was very happy to come back, because the role has changed, but I have the sense that I was a student and I benefited a lot from the institute, from the people in the institute, and I have a chance to do the same for the students as well as the institute. So, I am very happy to be back for that reason, to have a special connection to this place. Because I was not, I mean for me, I do not know how life would be like if you do not do certain things. You want to never say how, what kind of life, but for CMIT, the fact that I got into CMIT was like the, you know there are two paths you can take in life. This is like a big thing in my life, and the reason that, I mean the fact that I came here and studied here was a big turning point for me. So, I feel happy to be here every day. This is a really nice place, so I am really, I am very happy to come here and work. Because it is academically one of the top places, it gives us freedom to do what we want to do, and I have wonderful students. Every year there are great students who come to interact with me, and it is a joy. So, I am happy of course to be back here. So, what do you give to the students? I mean you were students once here. Yeah. So, do you, I mean you had, so at that point of time, some things, some good things will be there, some bad things will be there. Right. So, how? So, I, see one good thing when we were students was we were very small. We were six people in our batch. So, I think teachers were able to give much more personalized attention, and we were very close to them. I realize that that is very difficult here, because batch sizes are not small, still small, but not like six or ten. So, in that way I cannot individually keep talking to them and maintain a relationship that I had with my teachers. But still I would like to talk to them. I mean I hope I would convey that to them that they can talk to me about any problem. It is not same of course, I mean there is a gap. They do not feel maybe of me as an equal of course. I am not an equal for them, but maybe they do not feel so comfortable with me. I sometimes wish they are comfortable, but there is this gap that I cannot bridge. But more below that I feel like I am trying to help them, but as much as possible trying to understand what their needs are, what their feelings are, because I was also not a student. Though in a very different circumstance, I mean we were not here in a campus like this. We were staying in some apartments. CMI was in like a building, fourth floor. So, it is very different, but still talking about courses and what they go through. I try to help them, but it is not the same. I mean I always feel that I do not give them whatever my teachers gave me. So, I do not write them flawingly or in the situation. Is there any specific thing you can point out that you got this and you were not willing that? No, so it is not. So, generally like for example, we had a very close relationship with my teachers. We used to go to their houses for lunch, dinner and they used to hang out with us. So, it was very comfortable like you know teacher, but still very close personal relationship. So, obviously I do not have that with my students. I mean you know like I cannot invite them right because there is 25 people in my batch. In 2011 and now there are 45 people. So, we try to talk, but it is not the same. So, that way it is there is a gap between us. It is only limited to CMI and also occasional conversations like this. Some students are a bit more open. I try to talk to them, but generally as a group I do not know beyond some point I cannot establish a type of. Any advice, any final comments to students and parents? Yeah, I know. So, parents of course, I think CMI is a good place that you do not need to worry about it. If your child is interested in maths, this is one of the best places. I mean anything more is you do not need to worry about. For students I can say if you want to do maths or computer science or physics, you come to CMI, but then you have to work hard. So, one thing I have told my students in class also is if you study in IIT, it does not actually you do not need to study in these sections. Because IIT degree has some value. If you just finish your course, you get an IIT degree, you get a job. It does not matter what you learned or what you studied. Whereas, CMI is not like that. CMI is valuable because you studied and learned something. So, you come to CMI, you have to study. You cannot goof off like IIT. So, that is what I tell my students that you have to work hard. Because CMI BSc degree is really not important. Nobody cares about it. It is not like IIT. So, you have to work hard and presumably you have come to CMI because you like it. And you like the subject and you like this kind of mathematics or computer science or physics. So, you have to work hard. So, that is something we should keep in mind always. Thank you.\\n'"
