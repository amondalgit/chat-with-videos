## So, any other I mean apart from food or lodging any other concerns were there that institute is small and the parents were they convinced that they are sending to this institute, to this small institute, what will happen when they will come out or something like that? 
## Yes that concern was there then and is there today also, I mean what will they do after doing mathematics, what job will they get that is there even today. As per the size of the institute I think it did not matter because the batch sizes were also very small, relatively small like 6 students, 10 students. and the 4th batch was relatively large the BSc 4th batch. Even then I think the students the parents were not looking at the size of the institute and then they saw that all of us including from Seshadri to top to bottom all of us were sort of friendly and accommodative. So, they were convinced that it is a good place. One challenge that we had was library books, books as today it is it was not available as pirated PDF versions or PDF versions or even Indian editions most of the books were not available in Indian edition. So, even a simple book like the Artin or Apostle book will cost like about a 5000 rupees. So, this is something a student cannot buy, even today it is hard for a student to buy something like that and these are classic books and foundational books which every student has to have. So, at that point of time we actually bought. So, initially the class size was just 6. So, we bought 6 copies of Apostle, 6 copies of Artin and so on and later on of course, we realized that we cannot keep on increasing the number of books as students increase. So, of course, they had to you know share the books and things like that and the institute used to close at 5 o'clock which was a big disadvantage and nobody had heard of keeping the place open after office hours, especially the library everything used to be closed and this was a commercial building. So, it was probably not even safe for the kids to be there after certain hours, nobody will be there to be deserted completely. So, slowly we overcame all that and try to keep it open after office hours for 2 hours, 3 hours and slowly we moved. We also expanded by occupying more rooms in that same commercial building, slowly we added more lecture halls. We were on the 4th floor and then we moved occupied more of 4th floor, then we occupied 2nd floor, then we also occupied part of the terrace. So, it was like you know colonizing in some sense. After moving here of course, things have been very different. So, once the initial year I mean it went through, so now when we say I moved here. So, what were the challenges you faced when we scaled up a little bit? So, yeah. So, first thing is of course, after moving here, when we moved here in 2005 October, the hostel was not ready, only the part of the academic block was ready. So, it was up till this computer room, computer lab only that much part was there, this portion was not there at all. So, there was no separate library for example. So, and the building was half I mean not I would not say half, but it was not completely ready, about 10 percent of work was still pending, but we had to move because we had given notice at that place. So, we had to transport everybody to this campus, not just students of course, we all were staying in those parts. So, teaching staff, non-teaching staff and students because students were still living in T Nagar. So, we had this two buses, the huge buses know that software buses that you see today. So, we had this two huge buses which used to bring people to CMI and food was a problem again, there was no mess. So, the area that you see behind lecture hall 2, there is a cordoned off area know, I do not know if you have noticed that it has little fruit garden now. That place had a temporary shed and that is where food used to be served, we had a through some contacts we got somebody who will cater food here. So, morning breakfast and lunch and in between some tea, coffee it was served in that place. So, food used to be very bad, the catered food, but we all used to eat because we used to start from T Nagar at 7.30 in the morning including students. So, we will be hungry. So, we just used to eat whatever is available here. So, that was one problem that is logistics and of course, food. Second thing is out there it was a small place and then there were only some three computers or four computers for everybody to use other than the computer lab. For the teaching and non-teaching staff, we had some three or four computers. Since the place was small, we could just walk over and check our email or whatever and print and all that and come back, but here it is little you know bigger place. So, you know our offices are like individual offices. So, we had a few computers sitting in the admin office and we did not have proper furniture, we had all this furniture that you see today in the admin offices was came later. So, we had this table and chairs that we had brought from there. So, we had few table and chairs on which some computers used to sit and people used to come and check their email or print things or whatever. So, for a long time it was like that and what else was there specifically. Then there is a usual teething problems right something will leak and that year it rained a lot October.
## Yeah. So, this question is from the perspective of facility and the students problem and any other. So, students I would think they did not have. Because now a days students also increase. Yeah. So, what are the facility challenges in the. 
##Actually no because we had enough lecture halls here sufficient lecture halls and you must remember that those days technology was not so advanced. So, we did not need anything more than you know a blackboard and chalk and table whatever it is. So, things were going on smoothly actually, but as I said we had more lecture halls than we needed when we moved. So, some lecture halls where we made the board blackboard and all ready before we moved in and some of some of the other things we actually came and the work was going on while we were here. Because we did not need so many classrooms. So, I think we managed pretty well and overall there were no complaints from the students. Then about admissions during admissions right now we do the admissions here in this campus. We ask you all to come here to for the admissions on the admission day, but in those days nobody knew about this place. I do not think any auto wala or taxi wala will even bring people here. So, there was a marriage hall opposite old CMI Vani Mahal. Yes, I remember that. So, we rented Vani Mahal for a day and everybody we asked them to come there the students new students ask them to come there for admissions. 
##So, they came there and they come with their parents and as usual parents are anxious because some marriage hall mein admission chal raha hai what is going on you know kind of a thing. And then from there we used to bring all the kids here to this campus in shuttles and the distance is quite a lot. Now it is does not seem so, but those days it used quite a lot and they will come with luggage and we would not the shuttle that we used to have sometimes we will not be able to hold that much luggage and kids and all of us. And we used to fill everybody inside because we cannot make one more trip come here and go back and make one more trip that was not possible. So, I think we had two such tempo drivers and we used those to bring everybody here. This I think went on for couple of years then I think we this place was not so, remote. So, then we started having admissions here itself. 
##So, when you see now from then and now. So, what changes I mean are you satisfied with the kind of things which started there I mean the students problem fascinatingly is I mean the parents apprehension about the same. Now what you see a difference in that what parents think now about the same way before sending their kids to the same way is still the same thing or. 
##No it has changed quite a lot I think it is mostly because of internet perhaps because the parents can sit at home and see what is CMI about why should you do mathematics I mean the kid can also convince the parent why I should do mathematics or why I should go to CMI and not ISI or not IIT. The kid can show them various things on the internet and convince them still there are a few parents who have doubts and a change you are asking a major change is accessibility. So, now there is more accessibility in terms of travel and in terms of money. So, quite a few people parents and the kid they come and look at our campus once they get admission they come here and try to meet a few of us try to look around and see what we are and they do it for every institute. So, that has changed in the earlier days no parent would come you know few weeks before the admission and there was no accessibility also there was no money I would think to come and go make a picnic kind of a trip and go back. So, those things have changed and if you have to come from Kolkata you have to book a train and probably will take two days to come then you have to stay somewhere and you do not know where to stay then check out CMI go back just probably too much of a hassle. 
##Now what is the idea of this? 
##Yeah it has started maybe 10 years ago people come and take a look and go there are others who sometimes are coming this side some parent on work or maybe on some tour South India tour or something then they try to drop in and see what we are about. So, that has definitely changed and parents also know that doing mathematics is something useful it is not that you get only a teaching job in a school it is different perception has changed definitely. 
##And what would you say to the parents of the student and in future those who want to join CMI to convince them that this place is good what should they expect from CMI? 
##So, I never try to convince a parent that they the kid should join CMI because that is a decision that the candidate has to make. So, mostly I talk to the candidate who has come the kid who has come with the parent and try to find out from that kid in front of the parents actually what basically their child wants. And then make it clear to the parent that you know your child wants this. So, then they have questions about based on whatever they the child tells them they have some questions about on that which I can clarify that is what I do I we never try to say that this is the best place and you must come here it all depends on the interest of the child who has applied. Once student come here so what their parents should expect from this institution they will get a quality of quality of education and about the facilities they will get whatever they are thinking. 
##So, we in the admission along with the admission letter we also send a small PDF file telling each student what is available here in terms of hostel what is available inside the hostel and what we have here computer lab library physics lab whatever facilities we have here the shuttles whatever we have we tell them. And it is also clear that this is something very common to everybody over and above that of course, we do not try to promise anything because that is not practical, but after they come here if they have some specific requests and if it is practical we do try to accommodate them. So, I suppose from our the document that we send them with along with the admission letter admission details they know what to expect from CMI should be clear in their mind in terms of facilities. 
##After students they graduate from CMI so how they feel I mean how they feel about CMI I mean their expectation when they enter and when they are going out their expectation is matched or they came up with some something else, but they got something else and they are happy not happy or they are ultra happy I mean have you got experience of this. 
##So, I am not entirely about this, but some students do write back to us saying that how they had a very good experience in CMI or even when we meet and talk and all that. And I would think that most people are happy when they go out because lots of them come back here just to visit when they are if they are studying abroad they come back here when they come for a vacation they try to come for a day or two to CMI and I ask them kisli aayo, koi talk de rahe ho kya? Nahi I just came to meet friends and meet everybody. So, that sort of you know gives us so much joy that they are coming and there are others who write to us once in a while or keep in touch via telegram and sometimes our faculty members visit other institutes and our students are there as a student or a faculty member or as a PDF. So, they all enquire about you know each and every aspect of CMI about the people of CMI. So, considering all that I would think that students are happy when they leave CMI. Of course, it is there are people who have you know given us bad press also some people are very unhappy about some things that is also acceptable we accept it. Yeah, but by and large there have been no complaints about being a student in CMI. 
##I will have to ask him if he has any complaints. No, I am very happy like from my previous degree previous college this is very different and I like how much like transparent this college like how polite you feel when you are here. So, that image completely unique in CMI. Thank you. Even I have been in ISI. So, like it is not like that. 
##So, we grew organically from you know from 6 students to 300 plus that I think makes a large difference perhaps. So, we used to be like a family I was telling Sudhir yesterday that people used to students used to drop in at our home just like that or we will just we will be roaming around outside and we will meet some students. Then every passing out batch we used to go out for dinner with them take them out for dinner and in return the passing out batch used to take us out for dinner which is you know which is expensive for the students right. Yeah, though we used to say nahi karo it is not necessary they used to do it, but slowly the batches became much bigger and the student size is much bigger. So, I do not know every student now by name or by face like the initial days. So, as you get larger things do change in that sense, but our behavior towards students will not change and our students also they reciprocate in the same manner. So, we are very happy about that finally, students are our assets. Yeah. Yeah. So, without them there is no point in having a CMI. 
##Now, the future thing is any comments or any message for the future students and parents for both of them. What students should expect, what parents should expect or any other comments. 
##This is little harder to say about expectations. So, in terms of I would think the facilities we have of course, upgraded ourselves and kept ourselves with the latest like having Wi-Fi everywhere is one of those things. And I do not know what to say about and courses definitely we have added quite a lot of courses in our curriculum from what we used to be then and today. So, we have tried to upgrade ourselves and up keep ourselves updated in terms of the courses that are taught here. I make the time table every semester. So, I know that things have changed so vastly it is very different now. So, I do not know what else expectation wise what to say. 
##And parents should read whatever it is sent by CMI and everything whatever they are expecting everything is there in that document. 
##Yeah, it is a short document most people do not read unfortunately. That is why I am wondering. It is a single page document, single page with both sides and it is in bullet points like 1, 2, 3, 4, â¦. There is no large long explanation about anything because it is not necessary. We say room is twin sharing, what do you have to explain in this? Washing machines are there, what do you expect? So, people do not read still they keep asking. Everybody asks is there AC there? No, there is no AC. It is very hot there. Yes, it is hot. So, perhaps these things will not change expectations if the parents expect that their child should stay in an AC environment that is not going to change. Food wise things have changed tremendously. I remember the food that used to be served when the caterer was there. After that we had Sajji who is our current caterer. He earlier was an employee of a company and he used to try very hard to keep the food standard good. It was good. In recent years, maybe 4 years ago he floated his own company and now we have him as a contractor. Food quality has improved tremendously because everything is in his hands. Sports facilities of course we have added whatever we can and there is limited space that we have.
