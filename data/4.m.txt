 So, I think when you start a new program, the first problem usually is credibility right. So, the students have to be aware and have to and parents also have to be convinced that somehow this program will meet some quality expectation and will have that. So, in that sense having Tejasvi and others who came from the IMO joining did two things. One is of course, they were clearly choosing something which was relevant to their background and so for any student interested in mathematics, IMO was already established as a standard. And also within the student community especially the maths Olympiad community which was the main community at that time of students interested in maths outside school level, they also tended to follow what the senior students were doing. So, I think it was quite important step that we managed to get these two, I think Debapriyo from the first batch was also from the camp. But Tejasvi was not just from the camp, he was actually a rare case of an Indian gold medalist at IMO. So, that really helped to build that credibility and therefore, we never had an issue in that sense although of course, the number of students joining was always small in the first few years, but at least nobody had any doubts about whether those who were committed to it would get a good quality education. So, I think to build up that initial brand I think it was very important to have them.
